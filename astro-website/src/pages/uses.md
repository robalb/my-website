## My tools

- <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> - My go to editor

- <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> - A terminal multiplexer. Combined with vim, it's how i navigate and organize
  multiple terminals and projects.

- <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> - Together with Docker-compose, it's how i manage most of my local development and testing environments.

- <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> - It's how i manage all my projects but also, as a fan of the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/it/topics/devops/what-is-gitops">gitops</a> approach, it's
 how i manage most of my server infrastructure and desktop environment.

- <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">webstorm</a> - A powerful ide for the web. Sometimes vim is just not the right tool

- <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> - A quick way to setup reverse shells and test complex environments locally.

- <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">insomnia</a> - A good loking tool to test and call apis

- <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">burp suite</a> - An efficient tool to test and _break_ apis.

## Technical skills

### frontend

- Experienced in javascript/ES6, I use React + Redux as my preferred
   frontend stack
- I have experience with several javascript bundlers and SSG / SSR frameworks,
  my preferred ones at the moment are Vite, and Astro.build
- I'm far from being a designer, however i'm familiar with modern css and
  with some design tools such as adobe photoshop and gimp

### backend & languages

- I mostly write in javascript, python and java
- My choice for backend and api development is Python, with the FastAPI framework
  or Flask. In the past i've also used php and nodejs.
- I have experience with mysql, postgreSQL and redis

### Devops & infrastructure

- I mostly use github workflows, with ghcr as container registry for my CI/CD pipelines
- I work closely with kubernetes clusters in my daily operations, and all my project are
 deployed on a self managed k3s cluster running on cheap OVH VPSs
- On kubernetes, i like to use ArgoCD with a gitops approach
- I use Grafana and Prometheus to analyze and monitor my services and projects,
  and a Grafana-Loki stack for log aggregation and management
