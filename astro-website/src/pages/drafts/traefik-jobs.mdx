The careers page on the Traefik website has an interesting code challenge.
If you solve it, you will get the contact informations for the job application. 

```
# Apply here
docker run -it traefik/jobs
```

This is an overview of how I solved the challenge, The TL;DR is:
- I extracted a Golang executable from the container, and reverse-engineered it
to understand its behaviour.
- Following the code logic, I then deployed the container in a minikube cluster,
with cluster admin privileges.
- When this failed for compatibility reasons (the challenge is very old), I followed the path of least resistance,
extracting the "secret payload" from the executable and writing
a custom golang script that decrypted it using the same logic as the
original challenge.



### Helmsman, where are you? - Gathering clues

Running the command provided by the challenge, 
a Docker image is downloaded and run. 
It seems to be a simple program that prints a cryptic message,
then quits.

```bash
$ docker run -it traefik/jobs
> Helmsman, where are you? 🤔
```

By reading its [dockerHub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/traefik/jobs
), we learn that the image is 4 years old, and it's called `helmsman`. Only two other older versions are
displayed in the tags history.

Now let's have a look at its layers:

```md
$ docker history traefik/jobs
IMAGE          CREATED       CREATED BY                                      SIZE      COMMENT
8fd1aa093b13   4 years ago   ENTRYPOINT ["/start"]                           0B        buildkit.dockerfile.v0
<missing>      4 years ago   COPY helmsman /start # buildkit                 27.8MB    buildkit.dockerfile.v0
<missing>      4 years ago   LABEL helmsman=dcc9c530767c1020ad345d621cf29…   0B        buildkit.dockerfile.v0

```

It's a scratch docker image, with a single `27Mb` executable.
This is very likely a medium-sized Golang application, maybe a modified version of Traefik itself.
Let's pull it out of the image and find out.

First, we need to get a tarred copy of the image:
```bash
docker save traefik/jobs > traefikjobs.tar
```

These are the contents of the archive:
```md
$ tar tfv traefikjobs.tar
drwxr-xr-x 0/0               0 2020-10-22 15:50 blobs/

-rw-r--r-- 0/0              95 1970-01-01 01:00 repositories

```

We are only interested in the executable, which can be extracted from the blob with the largest size.
Let's have a look at it:

```
$ file start
start: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, Go BuildID=giKpqB_eEQ4pCsw_zwab/HXVXhwhlCd8onwlovFAY/b_HNul8q2i32pIwivh31/vGA8O26tkLqxQW-WXnoN, stripped
```

As expected, it's a static Golang executable.

### Solving strategies

To recap everything I've listed so far:
We have a Docker image with a 4-years old Golang executable,
that expects us to provide some kind of input.
Additionally, the docker image contains a label `LABEL helmsman=dcc9c530767c1020ad345d621cf29...`
that looks like some kind of password we need to feed to the application.

So far this feels like a "guessy" CTF challenge, which makes me feel at home.
I have enough experience to know that these challenges don't follow the typical programming patterns of the technology they use, and
because of that it's easy to be dragged away into time-consuming dead ends.

The trick to defeat them is to base every assumption on concrete data.
For example:
The app prints "helmsman where are you?", then quits. 
Do we need to provide into its
standard input the secret label we just found?<br/>
Instead of blindly trying every idea we have, Let's run the app with `strace`:

<Spoiler text="Show strace dump">

Since there is no report of any kind of `read` syscall, we can conclude that the program is not trying to read anything from the stdin,
and out initial hypothesis was wrong.

### The right path: k8s

Things get much more interesting when we analyze the executable from up close:

Even when compiled into a stripped executable, Golang programs maintain several [internal data
structures](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/golang-internals-symbol-recovery/) that expose
their original symbols.
Dumping the program into `GoReSym`, a tool that exploits these informations for the static analysis of Golang executables, we 
get this result:

```
/Users/emile/go/src/github.com/traefik/jobs/cmd/helmsman/helmsman.go
    main.main
      flag.StringVar
      flag.Parse
      flag.String
    main.console
    main.startServer
    main.getSecret
    main.getDeploymentFromPod
    main.getServiceFromDeployment
    main.getIngressFromService
    main.isTraefikDeployed
    main.decrypt
    main.startServer.func1

/Users/emile/go/src/github.com/traefik/jobs/vendor/k8s.io/client-go/
/Users/emile/go/src/github.com/traefik/jobs/vendor/github.com/spf13/

/Users/emile/go/src/github.com/traefik/jobs/vendor/golang.org/x/sys/unix/

```

From the dependencies alone, it's clear that this code interacts with the kubernetes API.
We also have a very clear overview of the program logic, which seems to be 
contained in a single file. The program starts a web server, decrypts something, and interacts
with a k8s cluster, checking if Traefik is deployed.

The hypothesis now is that if we deploy the container on a k8s cluster with the Traefik ingress controller (the best controller),
we'll somehow get our flag.
The symbols we found gave us a hint of what to do, but before we spin up our k8s cluster let's 
perform one extra step, and actually decompile the application.

<Image src={screen1} alt="Screenshot of the IDA decompiler, showing part of the helmsman code."/><br/>

Since the whole application logic is defined linearly in the `main.main` function, with no async channel crazyness,
The whole app behaviour can be read almost as easily as the original code. For example, 
this is the logic that prints the message "helmsman, where are you?". The relevant code snippets are highlighted in yellow.
There is a bit of noise originating from the [Go function call ABI](https://tip.golang.org/src/cmd/compile/abi-internal), but in this specific case we can ignore it.


<Image src={scr1} alt="Screenshot of the IDA decompiler, showing the part of the app code."/><br/>
The message gets printed when the call to `k8s.io/client-go/rest.InClusterConfig` fails.
Looking at its assembly, we can see the function tries to read the `KUBERNETES_SERVICES_HOST` env.
This is what failed when we tried to run the container without k8s. It's also worth noting that this behaviour does not generate any
syscall, we could have never seen it from `strace` alone.
<Image src={scr2} alt="Screenshot of the IDA decompiler, showing the part of the app code."/><br/>

There is a lot of other program behaviours that can be read from the source code, including a "secret" mode for local development.
I won't spoiler these details, nor the complete behaviour, you can easily read this yourself if you follow my steps.

### Deploying the container on minikube

Armed with the knowledge I gained from reversing the code, I set up a minikube cluster.
First, i wrote the manifests that defined a service account with `cluster-admin` privileges:
```yaml
---
# this is a service account with full admin privileges
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: traefikjobs
---
# This cluster role binding gives full admin privileges to the service account named "traefikjobs"
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: traefikjobs-cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: traefikjobs
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

```

Then I wrote the manifests for a simple Deployment, with Service and Ingress attached to the port 8888.
I believe that no one enjoys reading unrequested k8s manifests, so I won't force you to look at them unless you really want to.

<Spoiler text="See the manifests" >
```yaml

                port:
                  number: 8888

```

</Spoiler>

When I applied the manifests, I got this result:

```terminal

traefikjobs-696bb6fc8f-smxw4   0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   2 (18s ago)    39s
```

The challenge printed the message 

```md
It seems I do need more permissions... May I be promoted cluster-admin? 🙏
Look at me by the 8888 ingress 🚪
```

then went into a dreaded CrashLoopBackOff.
Thanks to the reversed source code, we can see that the CrashLoop is intentional: the program intentionally calls `sys.exit`
after printing this message. This is not an invitation to look at it by the ingress, it's a complaint that the `main.getServiceFromDeployment` function somehow failed.

The thing is, the Pod already has the `cluster-admin` permissions. We can confirm it by inspecting the service account, which has full access `[*]` to
all resources.

```
# k auth can-i --list --as=system:serviceaccount:default:traefikjobs
Resources                                       Non-Resource URLs  Resource Names   Verbs
*.*                                             []                 []               [*]
                                                [*]                []               [*]
selfsubjectreviews.authentication.k8s.io        []                 []               [create]
selfsubjectaccessreviews.authorization.k8s.io   []                 []               [create]
selfsubjectrulesreviews.authorization.k8s.io    []                 []               [create]
...
```

There might be a lot of trivial issues I might have missed, the only way to make
sure that the pod can access the kubernetes API is to exec into the pod, and manually try
to acces them. First, we need to replace the `traefik/jobs` image with a different one, that contains a shell.

```yaml
kind: Deployment
...
  - name: traefikjobs
    image: nicolaka/netshoot
    command: ["/bin/bash"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do ping localhost; sleep 60;done"]
```
```
# k rollout restart deployment traefikjobs
# k get pods
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
traefikjobs-6bb554c655-9sb9f   1/1     Running   0          77s
# k exec -it traefikjobs-6bb554c655-9sb9f -- /bin/bash
traefikjobs-6bb554c655-9sb9f:~#
```

From inside the pod, we can then try to access the kubernetes API. 
It's just a matter of installing kubectl, then running `kubectl auth can-i --list`.
As expected, I got the same results: The Pod has admin permissions.

### Taking a shortcut: static analysis

At this point it was clear that there were some issues with the challenge code,
I could even see the precise point in the assembly that had the error description I needed,
which sadly the program discarded before it's stdout print.

Instead of trying to fix the Deployment, I choose to follow the path of least resistance,
that in this case was the static analysis of the program.

By looking at the code, we can see that when everything is setup in the right way
the challenge will decrypt a hardcoded blob, and expose it from a web server it launches.<br/>
The content of that blob is our objective. The function calls before the decryption, roughly speaking, look like this:

```nasm
...
call    r_main__getSecret
call    r_runtime_mapaccess1_faststr ; args: ("helmsman")
call    r_encoding_base64_encodetostr
call    r_runtime_stringtoslicebyte
call    r_runtime_stringtoslicebyte ; args: (0, <SECRET_ENCRYPTED_DATA>, 0x288)
call    r_encoding_hexdecode
call    r_main__decrypt ; args: (cyphertext, keyparam)
```

And looking at the function `main.decrypt` we can see the Complete
Decrpytion logic: It's using the AES cypher library, in GCM mode.

<Image src={scr3} alt="Screenshot of the IDA decompiler, showing the part of the app code."/><br/>

We already have the encrypted blob, and the key is the one provided in the 
container label: `LABEL helmsman=dcc9c530767c1020ad345d621cf29...`

In order to Decrypt the content we need to figure out some extra details:
- what is the nonce? And how long is it?
- what is the tag size? How long is it?
- how is the key encoded before its use?
- how is the encrypted blob encoded before its use?

The GCM parameters exposed in the first function call already answer our first questions:
```nasm
mov     [rsp+0A8h+var_A8], rcx ; __int64
mov     [rsp+0A8h+var_A0], rdx ; __int64
mov     [rsp+0A8h+var_98], 0Ch ; __int64 (12)
mov     [rsp+0A8h+var_98+8], 10h ; __int64 (16)
call    r_crypto_cypher_newGCM
```

We can see from the documentation of [crypto/cipher.newGCMWithNonceAndTagSize](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.24.0:src/crypto/cipher/gcm.go)
that the 12 and 16 in the assembly are the nonce size and tag size respectively.

In order to answer the rest of the questions, we necessarily need to follow
the data flow in reverse, starting from the `main.decrypt` function call.

This is where some knowledge on Golang internals comes useful:
We know that `aes.NewCipher(key)` expects a slice as its only parameter.
So why do we see three parameters in the assembly listing?

```nasm
mov     [rsp+0A8h+var_8], rbp
lea     rbp, [rsp+0A8h+var_8]
mov     rax, [rsp+0A8h+rv_keyparam1]
mov     [rsp+0A8h+var_A8], rax ; __int64
mov     rax, [rsp+0A8h+rv_keyparam2]
mov     [rsp+0A8h+var_A0], rax ; __int64
mov     rax, [rsp+0A8h+rv_keyparam3]
mov     [rsp+0A8h+var_98], rax ; __int64
call    r_cryptoAES_newcypher
```
The answer is that the parameters `keyparam1, keyparam2, keyparam3` are the slice!
respectively its pointer, size and capacity.

If we follow them upstream, we'll reach the function arguments, which we can
then label with the proper informations

```nasm
mov     rax, [rsp+258h+rv_cypertext]
mov     [rsp+258h+r_function_args_stack], rax ; rv_ciphertext_1
mov     rax, [rsp+258h+rv_cyperthext_length]
mov     [rsp+258h+r_function_args_stack+8], rax ; rv_ciphertext_2
mov     rax, [rsp+258h+rv_cipertext_capacity]
mov     [rsp+258h+r_function_args_stack2], rax ; rv_ciphertext_3
mov     rax, [rsp+258h+rv_extracted_secret]
mov     [rsp+258h+r_function_args_stack2+8], rax ; rv_keyparam_1
mov     rcx, [rsp+258h+rv_extracted_secret_length]
mov     [rsp+258h+r_function_args_stack3], rcx ; rv_keyparam_2
mov     rdx, [rsp+258h+rv_extracted_secret_capacity]
mov     [rsp+258h+r_function_args_stack3+8], rdx ; rv_keyparam_3
call    r_main__decrypt
```

Following this data upstream, we can see that the ciphertext is read from an hardcoded string,
then converted into bytes with a call to `encoding/hex.Decode()`.
Weirdly enough, the key is not passed to `hex.decode()`, even though it looks like hex encoded data.
Instead, its ascii slice is directly converted into bytes.

With all these informations, we can now write our own decryption function

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/aes"
	"crypto/cipher"
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	contentHex := "SECRET_ENCRYPTED_DATA"
  content, err := hex.DecodeString(contentHex[0: 0x288])
	if err != nil {
		panic("failed to decode content: " + err.Error())
	}

	keyHex := "SECRET_KEY"
  key := []byte(keyHex)

	block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
	if err != nil {
		panic("failed to create AES cipher: " + err.Error())
	}

	gcm, err := cipher.NewGCM(block)
	if err != nil {
		panic("failed to initialize GCM: " + err.Error())
	}

  nonceSize := //REDACTED
	nonce := content[:nonceSize]
	ciphertextWithTag := content[nonceSize:]
	plaintext, err := gcm.Open(nil, nonce, ciphertextWithTag, nil)
	if err != nil {
		panic("decryption failed: " + err.Error())
	}

	fmt.Printf("Decrypted data: %s\n", plaintext)
}

```
