It's often said that assembly language is complex. Most people are scared of it, everyone avoids it.
 After all, there's a reason why high-level languages and compilers were invented, right?<br/>
But while it's true that you would have a hard time writing a large project in assembly, 
the language itself is surprisingly simple.
That's because Assembly is the native language of the processor, 
and at it's essence, all the processor does is moving data.

This guide is not about writing assembly; it's about understanding the way data moves
behind the scenes when you execute a program. We'll use concrete examples for the
x86-64 architecture, but these informations apply eveywhere and are foundamental knowledge 
for reverse engineering, binary exploitation, or just writing better code.

### what is data?

Data is just bits, representing information.
A sequence of bits can encode any kind of information, however this article will only focus
on text and integers.

But before we talk about any kind of encoding, we have to introduce a new notation:
The issue is that while circuits understand sequences of bits very well, humans don't.
For example, can you tell the difference between
`1101010101111110` and `1101010101111110` ?

<Spoiler text="Show answer">
Ok, the two sequences are identical, but I bet you couldn't immediately see that.
</Spoiler>

In order to visualize binary data in a more human friendly way, we use 
hexadecimal numbers, which associate a number or a letter
between A and F to a group of 4 bits.<br/>
A long sequence of bits can be represented in this way:

```
0010 0101 0111 1101 1111

 2    5    7    d    f
```

Note that in order to avoid confusion with decimal numbers, it's common to prefix
hexadecimal numbers with `0x`.
For example, `0x1234` is not the same
thing as the decimal number `1234`.<br/>
I'm not going to explain how conversions between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal numbers work,
The only assumption i'm making in this article is that you know that.<br/>
If you have a python terminal, you can perform these conversions very easily:

```python
al@thinkpad:~/$ python
>>>
>>> 0b0010 #print the binary number 0010 in decimal
2
>>> 0x1234 #print the hex number 1234 in decimal
4660
>>> hex(0b00100101011111011111) #print a binary number in hex
'0x257df'
>>> hex(4660) #print a decimal number in hex
'0x1234'
```

One more thing: we call a group of 8 bits a `byte`, but that's not the only 
group of bits with a name. The following table
contains all the names that you will encounter while working with the x86-64 architecture:

| N. of bits   | example hex value | name                   |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| 4            | f                 | nibble                 |
| 8            | ff                | byte                   |
| 16           | ffff              | word                   |
| 32           | fffffff           | dword (double word)    |
| 64           | fffffffffffff     | qword (quadruple word) |



### text

There are a lot of different ways to encode text, and I recommend that you 
read the [bare minimum foundamentals](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)
, it's a very interesting topic in itself.
In this article however we'll only focus on ASCII encoding, which is extremely simple:

All you need to know is that text is stored as a seqence of bytes. every byte represents a character,
so there are `127` possible characters between numbers, english letters and puctuation.
You can find a table of all the ascii characters in the
[linux man pages](https://man.archlinux.org/man/core/man-pages/ascii.7.en).

For example, the letter 'c' is stored as the byte `0x63`,
The letter 'o' is `0x6f`, 
The text `ciao` is stored as the sequence of bytes `63 69 61 6f`.


### where is data?

Now that we know how to represent text and numbers, we need some place
to store them.
Like all kind of data, we can store it in only two places:

- in memory, which means in your RAM
- in registers, which are special containers inside your CPU

### memory

Memory is just a very long list of
contiguous cells, each containing 8 bits of information, and reachable by a numeric address.

Since printing a long list of bytes would take a lot of space,
when visualizing memory we usually group bytes in rows of 8 or 16.
It's also common to include a column to the side that shows the ascii letter associated to each byte.

The memory dump below was taken from a program that was running on my computer. 
Use the slider to adjust the number of bytes you wanto to show in a row.

<SliderHexdump

  232, 4, 52, 40, 253, 6, 144, 31, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 127, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 66, 158, 135, 93, 202, 47, 126, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 64, 158, 194, 247, 255, 127, 0, 0, 104, 220, 255, 255, 255, 127, 0, 0, 152, 125, 85, 85, 85, 85, 0, 0, 224, 226, 255, 247, 255, 127, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

### registers

Registers are containers for data, located inside your CPU.
The x86-64 architecture has
[a lot of registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86#/media/File:Table_of_x86_Registers_svg.svg),
each with an associated name.
Some of them have a specific purpose, other are generic containers we can use in our program.
We mostly interact with these:

<RegistersTable />

<br/>

In order to understand these tables, we'll look at the register `rax`, displayed in the first row.
`rax` is a generic register that contains 8 bytes of data: from byte 0 to byte 7
as indicated by the byte numbers at the top of the table.

The register `eax` gives you access to the
lower 4 bytes of `rax`; reading or writing into `eax` is the same as reading or writing 
the bytes from 0 to 3 of `rax`.<br/>
Similarly, `ax` gives you access to the lower 2 bytes, and `al` to the lowest byte.

### Finally, some code

We are assuming that you are familiar with some programming language, it doesn't matter which one.
Assembly code syntax is similar to the programming language concepts you know:
a sequence of instructions, usually one on every line, that will be executed in order.

The x86-64 assembly syntax has two different dialects: AT&T and Intel.
All the code snippets in this article are using the Intel syntax.
The following snippet is an example of how the syntax looks like, don't worry about what it does for now.

```yaml
# this is a comment
push    rbp
mov     rbp, rsp
mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], edi
mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]
add     eax, 0x42
pop     rbp
ret
```

### moving data

The instruction `mov` moves data around. It can move data from a register to another,
from a register to memory, or vice-versa from memory to a register

 These first examples are self-explanatory:

```python
mov rbx, 0x10  #copies the integer 0x10 into rbx
mov rax, rbx   #copies the content of rbx into rax
```

Moving data to memory requires some extra syntax:<br/>
The following snippet writes the byte `0xff` in the memory cell at address `0x10`.

```c
mov rax, 0x10
mov byte ptr [rax], 0xff
```

Let's break it down:
- First, we put in a register `0x10`, the address of the cell we want to write to.
- Then we perform a mov instruction with square brackets around the register name, to indicate that we want to move `0xff` in
the memory address pointed by the register, and not into the register itself.

Notice how in that example we moved a single byte, and we used the syntax `byte ptr`.
You can change that in `word`, `dword` or `qword` if you want to move a different amount of bytes.

The interactive example below allows you to experiment with all possible variations of the pointer syntax.
You can click "run" to see how the memory is affected

<PtrSyntaxEmbed client:load />


### a sidenote on endianness

We managed to reach this point by ignoring an important fact: x86-64 is a little endian architecture,
which means that numbers are not stored in the way you would expect.<br/>
In the previous example, you saw what the number `0x4242424242424242` looks like in memory,
but we choose that number carefully to hide the issue. In the next example, you can choose the number you want.
You can enter either Decimal or Hex numbers, prefix Hex numbers with `0x`.<br/>
Can you spot the issue?

<EndiannessEmbed client:load /><br/>

You should have noticed that the bytes that compose a number are stored
in reverse order compared to the way we read and write them.
Both humans and computers use a positional number system to represent integers, where
the same digit has a different weight depending on its position.<br/>
When we represent numbers, we put the most significant digits to the left:

```
  1337
  |  |
  |  Least significant digit
  Most significant digit

  0xcafebabe
    |     |
    |     Least significant byte
    Most significant byte
```
In other words, we write the most significant value first.
In little endian architectures the least significant value is written first instead.

This topic is explained in details on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness), with some
useful diagrams that will solve any doubts you might have.<br/>
Endianness is only related to the way the processor handles numbers. Note how 
other kind of data, such as text, is usually encoded in the same order as you would expect.

### the stack

x64, like most architectures, has the concept of stack: an area in memory pointed
by the special register `rsp`.<br/>
You can add or remove elements from the top of the stack by using the
`push` and `pop` instructions. This is the most common interaction, but it's also valid to directly adjust the value of `rsp`.
In this interactive example
the stack area is highlighted in blue, and the contents of the `rsp` and `rax` registers are displayed.

<StackEmbed client:load /><br/>

There are two key elements you should notice by plaing with the example above:
- `rsp` points to the top of the stack. It is decreased by 8 when we push a value, and increased by 8 when we pop a value.
- Every time we pop a value from the stack that value is not deleted, the area of memory that contains it
simply stops being part of the stack. The only thing that changes is the memory address pointed by `rsp`.

Basically, `push rax` does the same as the following code:
```c
sub rsp, 8
mov qword ptr [rsp], rax
```

And `pop rax` does the same as the following code
```c
mov rax, qword ptr [rsp]
add rsp, 8
```

There is a confusing element here: when we put something onto the stack we are
growing the stack, and yet we are moving towards lower addresses of memory.

With the way we visualize memory this actually looks correct, the stack is growing 
towards the top.<br/>
But if we only look at the numeric adresses of elements on the stack, newer elements have smaller addresses,
which looks backwards.<br/>
Even when you are aware of this, it's common to get confused
and end up thinking:
"i put a new value on the stack, but it has a smaller address than the previous value, what is going on?"

### Further Reading

This article is still under development. My goal is to improve it over time, 
adding a section that explains stack frames and integrations with a real x86_64 emulator.
