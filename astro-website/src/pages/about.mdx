I'm a developer and Computer Science student at UniMib, living in Milan, Italy.

In a distant future I aspire to be a jack of all trades, master of one.<br/>
In my search for the one trade to master
I've experimented with web development in all of its forms - from frontend to backend, from design
to devops pipelines.<br/>
In 2023, I spent a year working as an infrastructure and backend developer in a consulting firm,
where I developed Cloud Infrastructure for large-scale web and AI projects.

Right now I'm focusing on completing my studies, 
practicing the art of binary exploitation and 
playing CTF competitions in my free time.


## About this blog

The design of this website is a fork of
<a href="https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com">Tania Rascia</a>'s
blog and uses her Newmoon dark theme for
 the code snippets. 
 The pages are plain HTML files generated using custom Astro.js code.
 I host them on an equally over-engineered infrastructure.

 If you find these technical details interesting,
 you may enjoy the [articles](/articles/#this-website) I've written about this blog,
  or the [/uses](/uses/) page,
 which describes the software and tools I use everyday.
