I enjoy experimenting with software at every level of abstraction,
from the high-level architectural decisions all the way down to the metal.
No matter what technology iâ€™m using, I'm always tempted to take it apart to understand it in depth.<br/>

I've worked in the field of DevOps, backend, and infrastructure development,
delivering cloud infrastructure solutions for large-scale projects.
Before that, I tutored in the practical cybersecurity CTF labs at my university, teaching web and binary exploitation.
You can check out what I'm up to right now by visiting the [projects](/projects) page, or the [Technical articles](/articles) I've written.

### About this Website
This website is part of an ongoing effort to improve my technical writing skills,
There are no invasive trackers, ads or affiliate links here.

The design is heavily inspired by 
<a href="https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com">Tania Rascia</a>'s
blog.
 All the pages are statically generated from Markdown files and a [custom Astro.js project](https://github.com/robalb/my-website), with 
 some sprinkles of tailored interactive elements.
 I host them on a slightly over-engineered Infrastructure.

 If you find these technical details interesting,
 you may enjoy the [articles](/articles/#this-website) I've written about this blog,
  or the [/uses](/uses/) page,
 which describes the software and tools I use everyday.
