I currently live in Berlin, but I was born and raised in Milan, Italy.

If i had to label my work, it would sit at the intersection of cloud architecture, product development, and cybersecurity research.  
The main point, however, is that i like computers: I like to understand in depth the abstraction layers they are made of, 
And i like to share what i learn with others.

I maintain x64.halb.it, a resource used by universities worldwide to teach assembly and system internals. 
It's an x86-64-Linux emulator and debugger that runs in the browser, powered by WebAssembly.   
I originally built it to teach reverse-engineering and binary exploitation to students who competed in Italy's national CTF competitions.  

### about this website

I use this website to document my projects before they get lost in time, and to refine my techincal writing skills.

When writing techinical articles, the target audience is usually my past self.
I try to be the person I wish i had met when I first started learning a topic.

### contacts

Feel free to contact me on [infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@al).
I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-ventafridda/) and [Github](https://github.com/robalb).

### under the hood of this website

The design of this website is heavily inspired by
<a href="https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com">Tania Rascia</a>'s
blog.
The website itself is made of a bunch of static html pages, optimized for accessibility and load speed, served by nginx running on a cheap VPS.

All the html pages are statically generated from Markdown files using a 
[custom Astro.js project](https://github.com/robalb/my-website),
with some sprinkles of tailored interactive elements.

 If you find these technical details interesting,
 you may enjoy the [articles](/articles/#this-website) I've written about this blog,
  or the [/uses](/uses/) page,
 which describes the software and tools I use everyday.
