Hey, welcome to my website!<br/>
If there is something you should know about me is that I like to take things apart to understand how
they work. I've been doing that since I was a kid, when I realized that it was possible to understand and modify
the javascript files powering my favourite games, and I haven't stopped ever since.

I've been lucky to work and experiment with all forms of web development - 
From Frontend to Backend, from DevOps to Cloud Infrastructure - Always trying to understand in depth the 
technologies I interact with.

Right now I'm mostly learning the art of Binary exploitation,
competing in Cybersecurity CTF (Capture The Flag) Competitions in my free time.
You can check out what I'm up to by visiting the [projects](/projects) page, or the [Technical articles](/articles) I've written.


### About this Website
This website is part of an ongoing effort to improve my technical writing skills.<br/>
'Writing is refined thinking';
I believe that strong technical writing directly correlates with better engineering.

The visual aspect of this website is heavily inspired by 
<a href="https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com">Tania Rascia</a>'s
blog.
 All pages are statically generated from Markdown files and a [custom Astro.js project](https://github.com/robalb/my-website), with 
 some sprinkles of tailored interactive elements.
 I host them on a slightly over-engineered Infrastructure.

 If you find these technical details interesting,
 you may enjoy the [articles](/articles/#this-website) I've written about this blog,
  or the [/uses](/uses/) page,
 which describes the software and tools I use everyday.
