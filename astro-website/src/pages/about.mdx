Hey, welcome to my website!<br/>
The main thing you should know about me is that I like to take things apart to
understand how they work.
I've started programming when I was a kid, when I realized 
that it was possible to modify
the javascript files powering my favourite games, and I haven't stopped ever since.

This early start gave me the opportunity to work and experiment with most areas of web development - 
From Frontend and Backend development to DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure.
Wathever the technology, I always aim to undestand it in depth, and 
to share what I learn with others.<br/>
I always try to be the kind of person I wish I'd met when I was learning.

Right now I'm mostly practicing the art of Binary exploitation,
competing in Cybersecurity CTF (Capture The Flag) Competitions in my free time.
You can check out what I'm up to by visiting the [projects](/projects) page, or the [Technical articles](/articles) I've written.


### About this Website
This website is part of an ongoing effort to improve my technical writing skills.
There are no invasive trackers, ads or affiliate links here.
I'm not trying to sell you anything.
In fact, the target audience for most of the articles I've written is the younger me
that struggled on some specific task. I'm not expecting to fool the SEO gods with that content
anytime soon.

The visual aspect of this website is heavily inspired by 
<a href="https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com">Tania Rascia</a>'s
blog.
 All pages are statically generated from Markdown files and a [custom Astro.js project](https://github.com/robalb/my-website), with 
 some sprinkles of tailored interactive elements.
 I host them on a slightly over-engineered Infrastructure.

 If you find these technical details interesting,
 you may enjoy the [articles](/articles/#this-website) I've written about this blog,
  or the [/uses](/uses/) page,
 which describes the software and tools I use everyday.
