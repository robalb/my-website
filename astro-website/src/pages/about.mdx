I'm passionate about designing reliable and well-maintainable systems.

I've had the pleasure to work across multiple software fields,
From Full Stack development to DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure.
No matter what technology I'm using, I always aim to understand it in depth. 
I'm not afraid to take something apart, traversing multiple stacks and abstraction levels all the way to the
assembly if it's necessary to solve an issue. And when I do, I love to share what I learn with others.<br/>

I always try to be the kind of person I wish I had met when I started learning,
and I value working in a stimulating environment where I can collaborate and learn from others.


Right now I'm mostly practicing the art of Binary exploitation,
competing in Cybersecurity CTF (Capture The Flag) Competitions in my free time.
You can check out what I'm up to by visiting the [projects](/projects) page, or the [Technical articles](/articles) I've written.


### About this Website
This website is part of an ongoing effort to improve my technical writing skills.
There are no invasive trackers, ads or affiliate links here.
I'm not trying to sell you anything.
In fact, the target audience for most of the articles I've written is the younger me
that struggled on some specific task.

The visual aspect of this website is heavily inspired by 
<a href="https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com">Tania Rascia</a>'s
blog.
 All pages are statically generated from Markdown files and a [custom Astro.js project](https://github.com/robalb/my-website), with 
 some sprinkles of tailored interactive elements.
 I host them on a slightly over-engineered Infrastructure.

 If you find these technical details interesting,
 you may enjoy the [articles](/articles/#this-website) I've written about this blog,
  or the [/uses](/uses/) page,
 which describes the software and tools I use everyday.
