### Parsers in exotic languages

Back in February 2022, I took a course at my university titled Programming Languages, which I thoroughly enjoyed.
A more fitting name for the course would have been Exotic Programming Languages,
as it focused on relatively obscure programming paradigms.

The final project consisted of implementing an URI parser in both Lisp and Prolog.
There were some extravagant requirements: the code had to be written exclusively in Emacs,
with a line limit of 80 columns, or it would be disqualified.<br/>
With that said, it was one of those rare situations in software development where all the project
requirements were defined in advance;
we had a detailed description of the grammar to implement
and an extensive set of tests the professor would use on the code.

You donâ€™t get that many chances in life to practice pure test-driven development:
I took a couple of days to write a ton of unit tests in Python, including tests for Emacs-like
code formatting and for the 80-line limit. Then, together with two other classmates,
we started the development. It was a pretty satisfying experience to know that when all tests passed,
you had the certainty of a full grade.

The code for the parsers and the language-agnostic unit tests is 
[on github](https://github.com/robalb/uri_parser_project)

The emacs [code formatter tests](https://github.com/robalb/uri_parser_project/blob/master/tests/tests_formatting.py)
could still be of use to some fellow unimib student 
looking to develop the project in vim, or some other editor forbidden by the emacs church

This was yet another university project, that took an unconfortable amount of my time across a couple of months 
back in 2022
