### Browser-based x86-64 Assembly playground

I recently created [x64.halb.it](https://x64.halb.it), An online assembly editor and debugger for the x86-64 architecture. <br/>
It's a website currently used by hundreds of users to share and write code snippets for popular assemblers, and to inspect the
result of their work in a feature-rich debugger and emulator.

The development has been an interesting technical challenge; A whole x86-64 linux environment
is emulated client-side in a WebAssembly port of the [blink](https://github.com/jart/blink/) emulator.
There is no backend server, everything runs locally in your browser
in a runtime that weights ~200Kb, less than the screenshot below.
You can find the source code on [github](https://github.com/robalb/x86-64-playground)

<br />

I created the website during my tutoring for the cyberchallenge course at UniMib, where I taught binary exploitation
in weekly training sessions.
In that course, students with potentially no experience with linux, terminals or debuggers were taught
core concepts like memory layouts and stack frames, and were then expected to immediately put this
knowledge into practice by exploiting basic buffer overflows.

I noticed that a lot of people were struggling to map the abstract concepts they learned into the 
practical tools they were expected to use, fighting both the concepts and the huge learning curve of gdb,
linux,terminals et all.

This website is therefore trying to provide a middle ground between abstract explanations of stack layout and
assembly and the actual tools used on the field. It displays information in the same way as
gdb+pwngdb, and it provides a user friendly debugger-like interface that runs in the familiar
environment of the browser.





### Custom VM emulator and debugger

I'm currently following [pwn.college](https://pwn.college), the
Arizona State University course on binary exploitation.
The reverse engineering challenges are obfuscated with a vm-based custom
architecture called yan85.
Although this wasn't stricty required to solve the challenges, I implemented
a yan85 emulator, assember, disassembler and a TUI debugger that 
simplified the reverse engineering process

<Picture src="custom-debugger" height={490} alt="Screenshot of a terminal showing a Textual User interface resembling a debugger. the terminal is split in two vertical sections. on the left there is a hexdump, on the right there is a disassembly listing. an ascii arrow points to the current instruction. At the bottom there is a row showing the values of some registers: registers A,B,C,D have a value of 0. register s has a value of 0x5, register f has a value of 0x6, which corresponds to the flags EZ. In the same row, there is a summary of the debugger commands: (s: step, r: reverse step, c: continue, ctrl-c: quit )" />
<br />

The tools are available on [github](https://github.com/robalb/custom-vm-emulator).
I doubt that they will be of use for anyone, since all challenges can be easily solved 
manually, and the time required to customize this code is longer than the time
required to solve a challenge.

At the moment i'm still following the course, and practicing binary exploitation by playing CTFs.
All my experiences on this subject are documented [in these articles](/articles/#pwn)

### Morse code web radio

This is an old project I started in 2018, during my first years of high school.<br/>
It's a realtime morse code chat, currently used by thousands of radio amateurs around the world to practice
morse code, with 1K weekly abitual users and ~3K registered users.
You can try it live on [morse.halb.it](https://morse.halb.it). The code is available on 
[github](https://github.com/robalb/morsechat).

<Picture src="morsechat" height={490} alt="Screenshot of a webapp. it's a chat, where all text is in morse code. At the bottom there is a single key. At the left side of the chat there is a panel: it shows two online users, one is typing. at the bottom there are some sliders, labelled: wpm, receiver volume, key volume. There is also a switch labelled 'show letters', and a settings buttom" />
<br/>

It's a pretty niche project, which is complex enough to span all main areas of web development.
It requires a database, real-time communication, authentication, and some custom ux and frontend functionality
that makes everything interesting.<br/>

These characteristics and the limited size of the project are the reasons I
use this website as a playground to test various web technologies. We learn from our mistakes,
and this is where I intentionally make my mistakes.<br/>
Everything started as a Php + vanilla js web app in 2018 which I then refactored into
a React+Redux monstruosity in 2021, 
running on an equally unnecessary Kubernetes cluster. Right now, it's being rewritten 
as a golang webserver

### Infrastructure

Between 2021 and 2022, driven by a curiosity to explore modern infrastructure and DevOps practices,
I containerized all my projects on Github and integrated CI/CD pipelines based on Github actions.

I also took the cursed decision to move everything to a self-managed k3s cluster, running on
an OVH vps provisioned through Ansible scripts.

<Picture height="400" src="helloworld-generic" alt="A diagram of a CI/CD pipeline involving github actions, a docker registry, argoCD and kubernetes" />
<br />

Since 2024, after more than a year working in the field of Devops and Cloud Infrastructure
development, I no longer have the requirement of artificial complexity in my personal projects.

Right now all my projects are hosted on a Hetzner VPS.
Each project is packaged with a Docker-compose file, and deployed using Ansible.
Everything is tightly integrated with a "base layer" running Traefik, a Grafana-Prometheus-Loki stack, and various other
utilities. The code for this infrastructure is publicly available [on github](https://github.com/robalb/my-infra).<br /> 
I'm working to put everything into a public template that will simplify
the process of running personal projects on a vps.


### Students management system

I started this project in 2020, in the last years of high school. The website is 
still online on [pinboards.halb.it](https://pinboards.halb.it), and an archive of the code
is available on [github](https://github.com/robalb/studentsplanner)

<Picture src="pinboards-1" height={590} alt="Screenshot of the landing page of pinboards.halb.it" />
<br/>

This web app was designed to simplify a critical issue:<br/>
In my high school, most professors followed the common practice of scheduling weekly oral tests.
It was a feared activity, worsened by the fact that the victims were usually selected randomly.
It was only towards the final years that they started
to allow volunteers, aware of the time it took to properly prepare for a test.<br/>
This shift meant that with a bit of organization, we could schedule all our oral exams weeks in advance -
A significant improvement in our quality of life!

Whenever a professor announced the start of an oral test season,
they typically provided details about the days of the week and the expected number of volunteers.<br/>
The class then gathered around a large cork pinboard, sketched the tests calendar with the empty slots to fill,
and started the complex process of finding the optimal candidate for each slot. The process vaguely resembled
traders fighting on an stock exchange floor.<br/>
Everyone had other oral exams, personal issues and countless other hard constraints that made this problem difficult
to solve by hand.

This webapp was a scheduling system designed to solve a very specific need for the time,
and it was incredibly succesful at that. It was written as a react webapp + php api, with some interesting
experimentations in the integration between react and php


<Picture src="pinboards-2" height={490} alt="Screenshot of the pinboards web app. It shows a calendar, with names in each slot. the calendar is labelled 'Inglese', and has an orange background. There are other calendars with other colors, that are minimized." />

### Sailing regattas Android app

This was a university group project, that took an unconfortable amount of my time
back in 2022.
The task was to develop an Android app in Java, adhering to Google's recommended best practices.

<Picture src="roboapp-figma" alt="some screens from an android app. The first screen is a login form. The second screen shows a list of regattas. The third screen shows the same page as the previous one, but there are no regattas, and a placeholder text is shown instead. The text says: 'There are no regattas. Regattas are interactive sailing courses that you can design and manage in real time with others. Create a new regatta with the create new regatta button.' The last screen shows a nautical map. a compass on top is pointing north, and a large text says 'Buoy stacchetto 40Â° N' On the map, a flag connected to a long line is overlayed on top of the water " />
<br/>

I worked with a group that developed an app for managing robotic buoys used in sailing regattas.
A pretty niche application, with interesting project requirements.
It featured a nautical map displaying a
customizable regatta track and provided real-time updates on the position of buoys and support boats.

I designed the figma design of the app, based on the new material design guidelines. 
I'm particularly proud that we managed to fully implement it.

I also wrote the app backend using FastAPI, and used the openapi documentation 
to automatically generate the schema for the Android Retrofit client.<br/>
Additionally, I established a basic CI/CD pipeline that automatically updated the 
app repository with new Retrofit client models whenever a new version of the API was released.

Both the app code and the API server are available on the [open-roboe github organization](https://github.com/open-roboe)


### Older projects

Around 2015, I learned programming by developing [minecraft pocket edition mods](https://web.archive.org/web/20190301083244/mcpedl.com/?s=robalb)
using a cursed javascript+java scripting language.

Since then, I've created several web projects that got lost in time,
along with miscellaneous stuff that is not worth its own section like
this website for [my old high school](https://github.com/liceobanfi/banfi-in-diretta), my
[my dotfiles](https://github.com/robalb/dotfiles),
or some university projects like this [URI parser in lisp and prolog](https://github.com/robalb/uri_parser_project)
