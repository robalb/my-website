### Custom VM emulator and debugger

I'm currently following [pwn.college](https://pwn.college), the
Arizona State University course on binary exploitation.
The reverse engineering challenges are obfuscated with a vm-based custom
architecture called yan85.
Although this wasn't stricty required to solve the challenges, I implemented
a yan85 emulator, assember, disassembler and a TUI debugger that 
simplified the reverse engineering process

<Picture src="custom-debugger" height={490} alt="Screenshot of a terminal showing a Textual User interface resembling a debugger. the terminal is split in two vertical sections. on the left there is a hexdump, on the right there is a disassembly listing. an ascii arrow points to the current instruction. At the bottom there is a row showing the values of some registers: registers A,B,C,D have a value of 0. register s has a value of 0x5, register f has a value of 0x6, which corresponds to the flags EZ. In the same row, there is a summary of the debugger commands: (s: step, r: reverse step, c: continue, ctrl-c: quit )" />
<br />

The tools are available on [github](https://github.com/robalb/custom-vm-emulator).
I doubt that they will be of use for anyone, since all challenges can be easily solved 
manually, and the time required to customize this code is longer than the time
required to solve a challenge.

At the moment i'm still following the course, and practicing binary exploitation by playing CTFs.
All my experiences on this subject are documented [in these articles](/articles/#pwn)


### Morse code web radio

This is an old project I started in 2018, during my first years of high school.<br/>
It's a realtime morse code chat, currently used by hundreds of radio amateurs around the world to practice
morse code.
You can try it live on [morse.halb.it](https://morse.halb.it). The code is available on 
[github](https://github.com/robalb/morsechat).

<Picture src="morsechat" height={490} alt="Screenshot of a webapp. it's a chat, where all text is in morse code. At the bottom there is a single key. At the left side of the chat there is a panel: it shows two online users, one is typing. at the bottom there are some sliders, labelled: wpm, receiver volume, key volume. There is also a switch labelled 'show letters', and a settings buttom" />
<br/>

It's clearly a pretty niche project, but it has the advantage of being large enough
to cover all main areas of web development:
It requires websocket communication, authentication, a database, settings synchronization,
custom code and ux for the morse chat.<br/>
For this reason, I've used it over the years as a playground to test various web technologies.

It went from being a php + vanilla js web app in 2018 to being a react+redux monstruosity in 2021, hosted
on an equally complex kubernetes cluster. Keep in mind that these were simpler times, I was not working,
and I wanted maximum complexity as the main requirement just for an extra challenge.

### Infrastructure

Between 2021 and 2022, driven by a curiosity to explore modern infrastructure and DevOps practices,
I containerized all my projects on Github and integrated CI/CD pipelines based on Github actions.

I also took the cursed decision to move everything to a self-managed, single-node k3s cluster, running on
an OVH vps provisioned through Ansible scripts.

<PictureThemed src="helloworld-generic" alt="A diagram of a CI/CD pipeline involving github actions, a docker registry, argoCD and kubernetes" />
<br />

For a while, the cluster successfully hosted all my personal projects. SSL certificates were managed by
Cert-manager, and Traefik served as the ingress controller.<br />
I also efficiently handled metrics and logs using a Loki-Prometheus-Grafana stack,
and managed Continuous Deployments with Argo CD.

After a year of infrastructure experimentation, i got a part-time job as
a backend and cloud infrastructure developer. 
At my job I was already managing unnecessarily complex k8s clusters and pipelines every day,
so I got rid of my personal cluster.

Currently, all my projects are hosted on a Hetzner VPS.
Each project is packaged with a Docker-compose file, and deployed using Ansible.
Everything is tightly integrated with a control plane running Traefik, a Grafana-Prometheus-Loki stack, and various other
utilities. The code for this infrastructure is publicly available [on github](https://github.com/robalb/my-infra).<br /> 
I'm working to put everything into a public template that will simplify
the process of running personal projects on a vps.


### Students management system

I started this project in 2020, in the last years of high school. The website is 
still online on [pinboards.halb.it](https://pinboards.halb.it), and an archive of the code
is available on [github](https://github.com/robalb/studentsplanner)

<Picture src="pinboards-1" height={590} alt="Screenshot of the landing page of pinboards.halb.it" />
<br/>

This web app was designed to simplify a critical issue:<br/>
In my high school, most professors followed the common practice of scheduling weekly oral tests.
It was a feared activity, worsened by the fact that the victims were usually selected randomly.
It was only towards the final years that they started
to allow volunteers, aware of the time it took to properly prepare for a test.<br/>
This shift meant that with a bit of organization, we could schedule all our oral exams weeks in advance -
A significant improvement in our quality of life!

Whenever a professor announced the start of an oral test season,
they typically provided details about the days of the week and the expected number of volunteers.<br/>
The class then gathered around a large cork pinboard, sketched the tests calendar with the empty slots to fill,
and started the complex process of finding the optimal candidate for each slot. The process vaguely resembled
traders fighting on an stock exchange floor.<br/>
Everyone had other oral exams, personal issues and countless other hard constraints that made this problem difficult
to solve by hand. The web app successfully solved the problem.


<Picture src="pinboards-2" height={490} alt="Screenshot of the pinboards web app. It shows a calendar, with names in each slot. the calendar is labelled 'Inglese', and has an orange background. There are other calendars with other colors, that are minimized." />
<br/>


### Parsers in exotic languages

Back in February 2022, I took a course at my university titled Programming Languages, which I particularly enjoyed.
A more fitting name for the course would have been Exotic Programming Languages,
as it focused on relatively obscure programming paradigms.

<PictureThemed src="uri-parser-diagram" height={390} alt="Railroad diagram of the URI ebpf grammar" />
<br/>

The final project consisted of implementing an URI parser in both Lisp and Prolog.
There were some extravagant requirements: the code had to be written exclusively in Emacs,
with a line limit of 80 columns, or it would be disqualified.<br/>
With that said, it was one of those rare situations in software development where all the project
requirements were defined in advance;
we had a detailed description of the grammar to implement
and an extensive set of tests the professor would use on the code.

You don’t get that many chances in life to practice pure test-driven development:
I took a couple of days to write a ton of unit tests in Python, including tests for Emacs-like
code formatting and for the 80-line limit. Then, together with two other classmates,
we started the development. It was a pretty satisfying experience to know that when all tests passed,
you had the certainty of a full grade.

The code for the parsers and the language-agnostic unit tests is 
[on github](https://github.com/robalb/uri_parser_project)

The emacs [code formatter tests](https://github.com/robalb/uri_parser_project/blob/master/tests/tests_formatting.py)
could still be of use to some fellow UniMib student 
looking to develop the project in vim, or some other editor forbidden by the emacs church


### Sailing regattas Android app

This was yet another university group project, that took an unconfortable amount of my time
back in 2022.
Our task was to develop an Android app in Java, adhering to Google's recommended best practices.

<Picture src="roboapp-figma" height={300} alt="some screens from an android app. The first screen is a login form. The second screen shows a list of regattas. The third screen shows the same page as the previous one, but there are no regattas, and a placeholder text is shown instead. The text says: 'There are no regattas. Regattas are interactive sailing courses that you can design and manage in real time with others. Create a new regatta with the create new regatta button.' The last screen shows a nautical map. a compass on top is pointing north, and a large text says 'Buoy stacchetto 40° N' On the map, a flag connected to a long line is overlayed on top of the water " />
<br/>

We decided to create an app for managing sailing regattas. It featured a nautical map displaying a
customizable regatta track and provided real-time updates on the position of buoys and support boats.

Android java development can be a scarring experience when your requirements are to follow Google's best practices to the letter.
Navigating through layers of outdated Java app development practices proved
to be far more complex than any webpack-react-redux or other convoluted web projects I've encountered.
I still have flashbacks about fighting `ViewModelProviderFactory` patterns, broken xml layout editors, and `LiveData` mixing with `rxJava`

The fact that i'm talking about this project however means that i enjoyed some parts of it.
In particular, I'm proud of the figma design I created, which we managed to fully implement.

I also enjoyed developing the API server for the app.
I wrote it in FastAPI, and used the openapi documentation 
to automatically generate the schema for the Android Retrofit client.<br/>
Additionally, I established a basic CI/CD pipeline that automatically created a pull request
on the app repository containing new Retrofit client models whenever a new version of the API was released.


Both the app code and the API server are available on the [open-roboe github organization](https://github.com/open-roboe)


### Older projects

Around 2015, I learned programming by developing [minecraft pocket edition mods](https://web.archive.org/web/20190301083244/mcpedl.com/?s=robalb)
using a cursed javascript+java scripting language.

Since then, I've created several web projects that got lost in time,
along with miscellaneous stuff that is not worth its own section such 
as a website for [my old high school](https://github.com/liceobanfi/banfi-in-diretta) or
[my dotfiles](https://github.com/robalb/dotfiles)
