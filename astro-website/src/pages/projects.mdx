### Custom VM emulator and debugger

I'm currently following [pwn.college](https://pwn.college), the
Arizona State University course on binary exploitation.
The reverse engineering challenges are obfuscated with a vm-based custom
architecture called yan85.
Although this wasn't stricty required to solve the challenges, I implemented
a yan85 emulator, assember, disassembler and a TUI debugger that 
simplified the reverse engineering process

<Picture src="custom-debugger" height={490} alt="" />
<br />

The tools are available on [github](https://github.com/robalb/custom-vm-emulator).
I doubt that they will be of use for anyone, since all challenges can be easily solved 
manually, and the time required to customize this code is longer than the time
required to solve a challenge.

At the moment i'm still following the course, and practicing binary exploitation by playing CTFs.
All my experiences on this subject are documented [in these articles](/articles/#pwn)


### This website

I created this website in 2022, after years of procrastination. I wanted a place to host CTF writeups, plus I wanted an excuse
to practice technical writing in english.

The website is built with Astro, a technology that at the time was still in beta.
Coming from a React background, I was seriously accustomed to the jsx syntax, and I was looking for a framework
that allowed me to write everything in markdown+jsx, and compiled to static html+css files.

Astro does exactly that, and additionally allows you to add interactive components in your articles,
written in wathever web framework you prefer.
If you've ever read an [article by Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski/color-spaces/), You may have an
idea of the potential of this feature.

So far, I've experimented with interactive elements written in Svelte in an article about
[visualizing data](/posts/moving-data-x64/) in x86-64 assembly.<br/>
I'm documenting everything related to this website [in these articles](/articles/this-website), and the code
is open source on [github](https://github.com/robalb/my-website)


### Morse code web radio

This is an old project I started in 2018, during my first years of highschool.<br/>
It's a realtime morse code chat, currently used by hundreds of radio amateurs around the world to practice
morse code.
You can try it live on [morse.halb.it](https://morse.halb.it). The code is available on 
[github](https://github.com/robalb/morsechat).

<Picture src="morsechat" height={490} alt="" />
<br/>

It's clearly a pretty niche project, but it has the advantage of being large enough
to cover all main areas of web development:
It requires websocket communication, authentication, a database, settings synchronization,
custom code and ux for the morse chat.<br/>
For this reason, I've used it over the years as a playground to test various web technologies.

It went from being a php + vanilla js web app in 2018 to being a react+redux monstruosity in 2021, hosted
on an equally complex kubernetes cluster. Keep in mind that these were simpler times, I was not working,
and I wanted maximum complexity as the main requirement just for an extra challenge.

### Infrastructure

Between 2021 and 2022 I realized I was lacking knowledge in infrastructure and devops processes,
so i took the decision to containerize all my projects, adding CI/CD pipelines based on github actions.

I also took the cursed decision to move everything on a self-managed, single-node k3s cluster, running on
an OVH vps provisioned via ansible scripts.

<PictureThemed src="helloworld-generic" alt="a diagram of a CI/CD pipeline involving github actions, a docker registry, argoCD and kubernetes" />
<br />

In its golden age, the cluster was running all my personal projects. SSL certificates were managed by
Cert-manager, and everything was served by the Traefik ingress.<br />
I was also managing metrics and logs with a loki-prometheus-grafana stack,
and managing Continuous deployments via argo CD.

After a year of infrastructure experimentation, i got a part-time job as
a backend and cloud infrastructure developer. 
At my job I was already managing unnecessarily complex k8s clusters and pipelines every day,
so I got rid of the cluster.

Right now, all my projects run on a Hetzner vps.
All projects are packaged with a docker-compose file, and deployed via ansible.
They are tightly integrated with a control plane running traefik, a grafana-prometheus-loki stack, and some other
utilities. the code is available [on github](https://github.com/robalb/my-infra).<br /> 
I'm working to put everything into a public template that will simplify
the process of running personal projects on a vps.


### Students management system

I started this project in 2020, in the last years of highschool. The website is 
still online on [pinboards.halb.it](https://pinboards.halb.it), and an archive of the code
is available on [github](https://github.com/robalb/studentsplanner)

<Picture src="pinboards-1" height={590} alt="" />
<br/>

This web app was designed to solve the scheduling of interrogazioni:
Short oral tests on the current class subject, usually scheduled randomly. A common practice 
That highschool students in Italy learn very quickly to fear.

During my last years of highschool, professors would schedule weekly oral tests,
but knowing the time it took to properly prepare they didn't choose the victims randomly, allowing
volunteers instead.<br/>
This basically meant that with some organization, we could schedule weeks in advance all oral exams.
A leap forward in our quality of life, except that now we had a scheduling problem.

Every time a professor announced the start of an oral test season, they usually provided details about the
days of the week and the amount of volunteers they expected.<br/>
The class then gathered around a large cork pinboard, sketched the tests calendar with the empty slots to fill,
and started the complex process of finding the optimal candidate for each slot. The process vaguely resembled
traders fighting on an exchange trading floor.<br/>
Everyone had other oral exams, personal issues and countless other hard constraints that made this problem difficult
to solve by hand. The web app successfully solved the problem.

### Parsers in exotic languages

Back in February 2022, I took a course at my university titled Programming Languages, which I thoroughly enjoyed.
A more fitting name for the course would have been Exotic Programming Languages,
as it focused on relatively obscure programming paradigms.

<PictureThemed src="uri-parser-diagram" height={390} alt="" />
<br/>

The final project consisted of implementing an URI parser in both Lisp and Prolog.
There were some extravagant requirements: the code had to be written exclusively in Emacs,
with a line limit of 80 columns, or it would be disqualified.<br/>
With that said, it was one of those rare situations in software development where all the project
requirements were defined in advance;
we had a detailed description of the grammar to implement
and an extensive set of tests the professor would use on the code.

You donâ€™t get that many chances in life to practice pure test-driven development:
I took a couple of days to write a ton of unit tests in Python, including tests for Emacs-like
code formatting and for the 80-line limit. Then, together with two other classmates,
we started the development. It was a pretty satisfying experience to know that when all tests passed,
you had the certainty of a full grade.

The code for the parsers and the language-agnostic unit tests is 
[on github](https://github.com/robalb/uri_parser_project)

The emacs [code formatter tests](https://github.com/robalb/uri_parser_project/blob/master/tests/tests_formatting.py)
could still be of use to some fellow UniMib student 
looking to develop the project in vim, or some other editor forbidden by the emacs church


### Sailing regattas Android app

This was yet another university group project, that took an unconfortable amount of my time
back in 2022.
Our task was to develop an Android app in Java, adhering to Google's recommended best practices.

<Picture src="roboapp-figma" height={300} alt="" />
<br/>

We decided to create an app for managing sailing regattas. It featured a nautical map displaying a
customizable regatta track and provided real-time updates on the position of buoys and support boats.

Android java development can be a scarring experience when your requirements are to follow Google's best practices to the letter.
Navigating through layers of outdated Java app development practices proved
to be far more complex than any webpack-react-redux or other convoluted web projects I've encountered.
I still have flashbacks about fighting `ViewModelProviderFactory` patterns, broken xml layout editors, and `LiveData` mixing with `rxJava`

The fact that i'm talking about this project however means that i enjoyed some parts of it.
In particular, I'm proud of the figma design I created, which we managed to fully implement.

I also enjoyed developing the API server for the app.
I wrote it in FastAPI, and used the openapi documentation 
to automatically generate the schema for the Android Retrofit client.<br/>
Additionally, I established a basic CI/CD pipeline that automatically created a pull request
on the app repository containing new Retrofit client models whenever a new version of the API was released.


Both the app code and the API server are available on the [open-roboe github organization](https://github.com/open-roboe)


### Older projects

Many projects did not survive the test of times.

Around 2016, I learned programming by developing [minecraft pocket edition mods](https://web.archive.org/web/20190301083244/mcpedl.com/?s=robalb)
In a cursed javascript+java scripting language.
