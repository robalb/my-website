The goal of this guide is to teach nuclear physicists with a deadline the minimal
information required to write C programs that interface to CAMAC systems, without the confusing parts

## What is a CAMAC system?

CAMAC is a [modular crate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_crate_electronics) used in the nuclear and particle physics industry for data aquisition. <br> In practical terms a CAMAC system is a metallic cabinet, called a **CRATE**, in which electronic modules can be inserted.

A CRATE has 24 stations, numbered 1-24 in which a module can be inserted.<br>
station 25, the rightmost station, is reserved for a **CRATE CONTROLLER** whose
purpose is to issue **CAMAC COMMANDS** to the modules and transfer information between a computer and the modules.

In this article we are going to focus on a specific CRATE CONTROLLER: the
[PCI-CC32](http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~craigim/pdfmanuals/manuals/Man-PciCc32-A1.pdf)
from ARW Elektroniks Which connects to a Linux computer.

Highlighted in this picture: A CAMAC CRATE in the wild. Station 12, 16, and 21 are occupied by some modules.
Station 24-25 is occupied by the CRATE CONTROLLER. You can see the cable that connects it to the computer.
<br/>


Some modules just draw power from the crate, and have all of their data inputs and outputs on the front plate.<br/>
Other modules also take inputs or CAMAC COMMANDS from the CRATE CONTROLLER connected to the computer. We are interested in these modules since ultimately our goal is to control them with the computer.

### what is a CAMAC command ?

As we mentioned, a CRATE CONTROLLER can issue a CAMAC COMMAND.
These commands are often expressed in the following notation:

```
    N()  A()  F() [optional data]
```

- N is the station number, an integer in the range 1-24.
  For example N(2) will select the station in position 2. (station and module are synonims)
- A is a subaddress, an integer in the range 0-15. For example if we are talking to a module that has 8 different registries, we can specify the first register with A(0), the second register with A(1) and so on.
- F is the function code to be performed at the selected module and subadress.
  If you want to know the function codes supported by a module you will have to read its documentation.

In response a module will generate an X (command accepted)
and Q (response) signals. For simplicity, you can see X and Q as two boolean variables.

Up to 24 bits of additional data can be transferred between the CRATE CONTROLLER
and the selected module when a NAF command is sent.<br/>
You must read the documentation of a module to know the function codes that it supports, but in general:
- Function codes in the range 0-7 are read commands:
  they can return additional data other than Q and X
- Function codes in the range 16-23 are write commands:
  they accept additional data other than N, A, F, that will be sent to the module


### The Look At Me signal

A CAMAC module can generate a **Look At Me** (L) signal at any time, to indicate to the CRATE CONTROLLER
that it requires attention.
The documentation of a module will describe when it will activate these signals, and the functions
to enable, disable, or reset them.

You don't have to worry too much about these signals for now, just know that they exist.


### special commands

A CAMAC CONTROLLER can also issue special
commands that are sent to all the CAMAC modules simultaneously:

- (Z) INITIALIZE: It sets all modules to a basic state by resetting all registers and resetting all L signals (look at me) and disabling them where possible.

- (I) INHIBIT ON / OFF: when inhibit is ON, any activity such as data taking is inhibited

- (C) CLEAR: clear all registers in the modules connected to the crate.

As always, the way a module reacts to Z, I, or C commands is described in its documentation. Often Z and C have the same effect on a module


### controlling a CAMAC crate with a C program

You have learned that a camac controller can send NAF commands to a specific module,
or Initialize, Inhibit and Clear commands to all modules at the same time.
also you learned that a camac controller can receive L (Look at me) signals from the modules.

You can perform all these operations from a C program by importing the pcicc32 library.

Using the library, you can send NAF commands to the CRATE.

example: This made-up NAF command: N4*A1*F9 
can be sent with this function call

    cc32_write_word (handle, 4, 1, 9, 0);  //call function 9 on module 4, subaddress 1

There are also special commands that are expressed in NAF notation but that have a special meaning:

```
(in all these commands Fx is any integer >= 16)

N0*A0*Fx = C (Camac Clear)
N0*A1*Fx = Z (Camac Initialize)
N0*A2*Fx = C + Inhibit off
N0*A3*Fx = Z + Inhibit On
N27*A0*Fx = Inhibit On
N27*A1*Fx = Inhibit Off
```

example:

```cpp
cc32_write_word (handle, 0, 0, 16, 0);  //camac clear (C)
cc32_write_word (handle, 0, 1, 16, 0);  //camac initialize (Z)
cc32_write_word (handle, 27, 0, 16, 0); //set inhibit (I on)
cc32_write_word (handle, 27, 1, 16, 0); //reset inhibit (I off)
```

All these commands are described in details in a table in section 3.3 of the 
[PCI-CC32 hardware manual](http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~craigim/pdfmanuals/manuals/Man-PciCc32-A1.pdf),
A simplified and more readable documentation is available in section 7.3 of the 
[library documentation](http://mu2e.phy.duke.edu/cw/CAMAC/Wiener/CD36/PciCamac/Pcicc32W95NT-A1.pdf)


### Reading documentation

The only way to know the correct NAF commands to send to a module is to read the module documentation.
Here is an example
