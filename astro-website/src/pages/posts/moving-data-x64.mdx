It's often said that assembly language is complex.
 After all, there's a reason why high-level languages and compilers existâ€”to spare us the intricacies, right?<br/>
But while it's true that you would have a hard time writing a large project in assembly, the language itself
is remarcably simple. That's because Assembly is the language of the processor, 
and at it's essence, all the processor does is moving data.

This guide is not about writing assembly; it's about understanding the way memory moves
behind the scenes when you execute a program. We'll use concrete examples for the
x86-64 architecture, but these informations apply eveywhere and are foundamental knowledge 
for reverse engineering, binary exploitation, or simply program debugging

### what is data?

Data is just bits, representing information.
A sequence of bits can encode any kind of information, however this article will only focus
on text and integers.

But before we talk about any kind of encoding, we have to introduce a new notation:
The issue is that while circuits understand sequences of bits very well, humans don't.
For example, can you tell the difference between
`1101010101111110` and `1101010101111110` ?

<Spoiler text="Show answer">
Ok, the two sequences are identical, but I bet you couldn't immediately see that.
</Spoiler>

In order to visualize binary data in a more human friendly way, we use 
hexadecimal numbers, which associate a number or a letter
between A and F to a group of 4 bits.<br/>
A long sequence of bits can be represented in this way:

```
0010 0101 0111 1101 1111

 2    5    7    d    f
```

Note that in order to avoid confusion with decimal numbers, it's common to prefix
hexadecimal numbers with `0x`.
For example, `0x1234` is not the same
thing as the decimal number `1234`.<br/>
I'm not going to explain how conversions between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal numbers work,
The only assumption i'm making in this article is that you know that.<br/>
If you have a python terminal, you can perform these conversions very easily:

```python
al@thinkpad:~/$ python
>>>
>>> 0b0010 #print the binary number 0010 in decimal
2
>>> 0x1234 #print the hex number 1234 in decimal
4660
>>> hex(0b00100101011111011111)
'0x257df'
>>> hex(4660)
'0x1234'
```

One last convention you should know is that
a group of bits has a name, based on how long it is:

| N. of bits   | example hex value | name                   |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| 4            | f                 | nibble                 |
| 8            | ff                | byte                   |
| 16           | ffff              | word                   |
| 32           | fffffff           | dword (double word)    |
| 64           | fffffffffffff     | qword (quadruple word) |



### text

[You probably know](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)
 that there are different ways to encode text. The simplest encoding is ascii,
 where text is stored as a sequence of bytes
and every byte represent a letter.<br/>
For example, the letter 'c' is stored as the byte `0x63`,
The letter 'o' is `0x6f`, 
The text `ciao` is stored as the sequence of bytes `63 69 61 6f`.
You can find a table of all ascii letters in the
[linux man pages](https://man.archlinux.org/man/core/man-pages/ascii.7.en).

Text is a very good example of how data is usually encoded
in the same order as you normally write it.
For example, 'ciao' is stored as the byte for c, followed by the byte for i, and so on.
You will see that this is not the case with numbers.



### numbers

Integers in the x86-64 architecture are stored in little endian format.

Let's take a decimal number, for example 3405691582:
Converted to binary, that number is `0xcafebabe`.<br/>
Unlike what we saw with text, those bytes will not be stored in order.
Instead, little endian architectures will take a number, split it by bytes,
and store those bytes in a reversed order.

```
0xcafebabe

will be store as:

be ba fe ca
```

For example, let's say that you encounter the byte sequence `02 ff 00 00 00 00 00 00`,
what decimal number is it?

<Spoiler text="Show answer">
- we need to take all the bytes, in reverse order. that's `0x000000000000ff02`
- exaclty like in decimal, leading zeros are meaningles, so we can remove them. we get `0xff02`
- using python, we can convert it to decimal. we get: `65282`
</Spoiler>


### where is data?

Now that we know how to represent text and numbers, we need some place
to store them.
Like all kind of data, we can store it in only two places:

- in memory, which means in your RAM
- in registers, which are special containers inside your CPU

### memory

Memory is just a very long list of
contiguous cells, each containing 8 bits of information, and reachable by a numeric address.

Since printing a long list of bytes would take a lot of space,
when visualizing memory we usually group bytes in rows of 8 or 16.
It's also common to include a column to the side that shows the ascii letter associated to each byte.

The memory dump below was taken from a program that was running on my computer. 
Use the slider to adjust the number of bytes you wanto to show in a row.

<SliderHexdump
  client:load 
  showAscii={true}
  data={[
  80, 97, 103, 101, 32, 110, 111, 116, 32, 102, 111, 117, 110, 100, 127, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 233, 81, 85, 85, 85, 85, 0, 0, 64, 220, 255, 255, 1, 0, 0, 0, 88, 220, 255, 255, 255, 127, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 232, 4, 190, 18, 120, 233, 111, 224, 88, 220, 255, 255, 255, 127, 0, 0, 233, 81, 85, 85, 85, 85, 0, 0, 152, 125, 85, 85, 85, 85, 0, 0, 64, 208, 255, 247, 255, 127, 0, 0, 232, 4, 28, 164, 135, 22, 144, 31,
  232, 4, 52, 40, 253, 6, 144, 31, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 127, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 66, 158, 135, 93, 202, 47, 126, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 64, 158, 194, 247, 255, 127, 0, 0, 104, 220, 255, 255, 255, 127, 0, 0, 152, 125, 85, 85, 85, 85, 0, 0, 224, 226, 255, 247, 255, 127, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 81, 85, 85, 85, 85, 0, 0

### registers

Registers are containers for data, located inside your CPU.
The x86-64 architecture has
[a lot of registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86#/media/File:Table_of_x86_Registers_svg.svg),
each with an associated name.
Some of them have a specific purpose, other are generic containers we can use in our program.
We mostly interact with these one:

<RegistersTable />

<br/>

As you can see from the table above, registers that start with the prefix `r` can store 8 bytes of data.
There are registers that give you access to the lower bytes of larger registers.
for example `eax` gives you access to the lower 4 bytes of `rax`.

### Finally, some code

We are assuming that you are familiar with some programming language, it doesn't matter which one.
Assembly code syntax is similar to the programming language concepts you know:
a sequence of instructions, usually one on every line, that will be executed in order.

The x86-64 assembly syntax has two different dialects: AT&T and Intel.
All the code snippets in this article are using the Intel syntax.
Just to give you an example, this is a snippet of assembly code. You don't have to understand it

```yaml
# this is a comment
push    rbp
mov     rbp, rsp
mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], edi
mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]
add     eax, 0x42
pop     rbp
ret
```

### moving data

The instruction `mov` moves data around. It can move data from a register to another,
from a register to memory, or vice-versa from memory to a register

 These first examples are self-explanatory:

```python
mov rbx, 0x10  #copies the integer 0x10 into rbx
mov rax, rbx   #copies the content of rbx into rax
```

Moving data to memory requires some extra syntax:<br/>
The following snippet writes the byte `0xff` in the memory cell at address `0x10`.

```c
mov rax, 0x10
mov byte ptr [rax], 0xff
```

Let's break it down:
- First, we put in a register `0x10`, the address to the cell we want to write.
- Then we perform a mov instruction with square brackets around the register name, to indicate that we want to move `0xff` in
the memory address pointed by the register, and not into the register itself.

Notice how in that example we moved a single byte, and we used the syntax `byte ptr`.
You can change that in `word`, `dword` or `qword` if you want to move a different amount of bytes.

The interactive example below allows you to experiment with all possible variations of the pointer syntax.
You can click "run" to see how the memory is affected

<PtrSyntaxEmbed client:load />

<PtrHexdump
  client:load 
  showAscii={false}
  sliderStart={0} />

### the stack

x64, like most architectures, has the concept of stack: an area in memory pointed
by the special register `rsp`.<br/>
You can add or remove elements from the top of the stack by using the
`push` and `pop` instructions. This is the most common interaction, but it's also valid to directly adjust the value of `rsp`.
This interactive example allows you to experiment with `push` and `pop`.
The stack area is highlighted in blue and displayed below, togehther with the contents of the `rsp` and `rax` registers.

<PushHexdump 
  client:load
  centered={false}
  showAscii={true} />
<br/>

There are two key elements you should notice by plaing with the example above:
- `rsp` points to the top of the stack. It is decreased by 8 when we push a value, and increased by 8 when we pop a value.
- Every time we pop a value from the stack that value is not deleted, the area of memory that contains it
simply stops being part of the stack. The only thing that changes is the memory address pointed by `rsp`.

Basically, `push rax` does the same as the following code:
```c
sub rsp, 8
mov qword ptr [rsp], rax
```

And `pop rax` does the same as the following code
```c
mov rax, qword ptr [rsp]
add rsp, 8
```

There is a confusing element here: when we put something onto the stack we are
growing the stack, and yet we are moving towards lower addresses of memory.

With the way we visualize memory this actually looks correct, the stack is growing 
towards the top.<br/>
But if we only look at the numeric adresses of elements on the stack newer elements have smaller addresses,
which looks backwards.<br/>
Even when you are aware of this, it's common to get confused
and end up thinking:
"i put a new value on the stack, and it has a smaller address than the previous value, how it is possible?"

This article is still under development. My goal is to improve it over time, 
adding a section that explains stack frames and integrations with a real x86_64 emulator.
