This is the opinionated way I manage my ssh keys. <br/>


If you are not familiar with the topic, but you use software like ssh or git
this article explains useful information that will solve you some googling one day. This is all you need to know:


- Ssh keys are a safer alternative to passwords for authenticating to an ssh remote server. 

- [git supports ssh](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols) to connect to remote repositories. This makes ssh keys the recommended (and the easiest) way to authenticate to git servers like github

### generating a key

This command will generate a brand new key:<br/>
`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "key description" -f ~/.ssh/test_key`<br/>
The sensible default is to save all keys in the `.ssh` folder in your home directory.

<Spoiler text="what is a key?">

### what is a key?

The key is actually a key pair.
If you inspect the contents of your `.ssh` folder after running the key generation command, you will find these two new files:
```
test_key
test_key.pub
```

They are both text files.
The first one contains The private key, it should look like this:

```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
d2hhdCBhIG5lcmQuIHdoeSBhcmUgeW91IHJlYWRpbmcgdGhpcz8KCgpkMmhoZENCaElHNW
xjbVF1SUhkb2VTQmhjbVVnZVc5MUlISmxZV1JwYm1jZ2RHaHBjdz09CgoKZDJoaGRDQmhJ
RzVsY21RdUlIZG9lU0JoY21VZ2VXOTFJSEpsWVdScGJtY2dkR2hwY3dwa01taG9aRU5DYU
VsSE5XeGpiVkYxU1Voa2IyVlRRbWhqYlZWblpWYzVNVWxJU214WlYxSndZbTFqWjJSSGFI
QmpkejA5CgoK==
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

The second file contains the public key, it should look like this:
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAILdfizrm/YFxBOR23rJMQjHOI8m2zqm3a6wMl41tMehg key description
```

Private and public keys are always generated in pair, and work in pair like a padlock and its key.
The idea is that you can copy the public key to a remote ssh server (usually in the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`),
and when you connect to it your ssh client will use the private key
to authenticate automatically, without you having to type any password.

You can also [add an ssh public key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to your github account. It will allow your local git client to automatically authenticate to github. Gitlab and other services have similar options.

### the case for using dedicated ssh keys

When ssh tries to authenticate via public key, [it sends the server all your public keys](https://github.com/FiloSottile/whoami.filippo.io?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works), one by one, until the server accepts one.
This is a minor information disclosure issue, since public keys can then be used to link someone's presence to [private infrastructure](https://rushter.com/blog/public-ssh-keys/), or github accounts. <br/>
You can see this in action by running running ssh with the `-v` flag, or by connecting to<br/>
`ssh whoami.filippo.io`

For this reason, I like to generate a dedicated ssh key for every service that requires it,
and explicitly associated the key to the host in the `.ssh/config` file.

### managing multiple github accounts

The nice bonus of manually associating keys to hosts is that this 
makes it very easy to authenticate to multiple github accounts.<br/>
For example, I created a host alias for my work github account called `github.com.work`. <br/>
Every time I need to clone a github repository from my work account, i simply run
`git clone git@github.com.work:organization/repository.git` and my ssh client will automatically
use the correct key


### putting everything together

This is an example of ssh config that integrates everything


```toml
#~/.ssh/config

#some ssh server
Host homelab.local
  User admin
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  PubkeyAuthentication yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_homelab

#personal github.com
Host github.com
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  PubkeyAuthentication yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_personal_github

#work github.com (example usage: git clone git@github.com.work:your-repo.git)
Host github.com.work
  HostName github.com
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  PubkeyAuthentication yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_work_github

# By default, connect to a ssh server with user ubuntu - a very common username,
# and don't send any ssh public key to avoid information disclosure to potential attackers.
# This block must be at the END of the config file
Host *
  PubkeyAuthentication no
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  IdentityFile ~/nonexistent
  User ubuntu

```
