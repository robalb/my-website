After only five years since the purchase of the domain, this website is now finally alive.
It's actually an impressive timing for a personal project, and this calls for an inaugural blog post.

## the tech stack

This blog is built with [Astro.build](https://astro.build).<br/>
It's composed of simple html+css components, that astro combines with markdown files to create the pages you are
reading now. 
It's important to point out that the design is not mine, it's a fork of 
<a href="https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com">tania rascia</a>'s own blog. I basically copied all of her css
which is on github under a MIT license.

The static pages generated by astro are hosted by an nginx webserver deployed  on my kubernetes cluster.
The deployment process is pretty straightforward:

- Every time there is a change on the master branch of the repository a simple github action is triggered,
 which builds the new website into a distroless nginx docker container and pushes the image on a registry.

- After the new docker image has been succesffully pushed to the registry, another job updates the tag reference in the 
relevant kubernetes manifest files in the repository, and commits the changes.

- Finally, argoCD running on my k3s cluster recognizes the changes in the kubernetes manifests, and automatically start a
sync process.

<img src={a} style="width: 30rem; height:auto; margin: 0 auto;" class="dark"/>
<img src={b} style="width: 30rem; height:auto; margin: 0 auto;" class="light"/>

<br/>

This whole process is, of course, a huge overkill, and the fact that right now you are reading this and not a service:unavailable
page is the result of a chain of multiple miracles
