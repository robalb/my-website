This is the second part of a series of interactive articles on the x86-64 architecture.
This part will focus on the first assembly instructions, visualizing the way data moves in memory
when they are executed.

- stack frames

### Visualizing memory

In the [previous post](/posts/x64-introduction)
we introduced some basics on data, encodings, and the places
where data is stored: registers and memory.
We also introduced a common way to visualize memory, that will be used extensively
in this article: hex dumps.

The example below shows a hexdump of some example data taken from the stack frame of a process.
Use the slider to adjust the number of bytes you want to see in a single row.

<SliderHexdump
  client:load 
  showAscii={true}
  data={[
  0x65, 0x78, 0x61, 0x6d, 0x70, 0x6c, 0x65, 0x20,
  0x61, 0x73, 0x63, 0x69, 0x69, 0x20, 0x74, 0x65,
  0x78, 0x74, 
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 233, 81, 85, 85, 85, 85, 0, 0, 64, 220, 255, 255, 1, 0, 0, 0, 88, 220, 255, 255, 255, 127, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 232, 4, 190, 18, 120, 233, 111, 224, 88, 220, 255, 255, 255, 127, 0, 0, 233, 81, 85, 85, 85, 85, 0, 0, 152, 125, 85, 85, 85, 85, 0, 0, 64, 208, 255, 247, 255, 127, 0, 0, 232, 4, 28, 164, 135, 22, 144, 31,
  232, 4, 52, 40, 253, 6, 144, 31, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 127, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 66, 158, 135, 93, 202, 47, 126, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 64, 158, 194, 247, 255, 127, 0, 0, 104, 220, 255, 255, 255, 127, 0, 0, 152, 125, 85, 85, 85, 85, 0, 0, 224, 226, 255, 247, 255, 127, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 81, 85, 85, 85, 85, 0, 0

  The reason I want you to familiarize with this visualization is also the rationale behind
  this series of articles:
  Most resources online explain low-level topics (such as 
  stack frames, data alignment, or buffer overflows) using
  [abstract diagrams](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40106523/9169799).
  But when you will approach these topics in practice, you will use
  tools like gdb, that visualize data in a completely different way compared to the diagrams.<br/>
  For example, this is a screenshot of my setup when 
  [running gdb with GEF and the python pwntools library](/posts/pwntools-gdb):

<Picture src="gdb-tips" height={450} alt="Screenshot of a tmux terminal split vertically into two panes. The pane on the left is an interactive python shell. It has received the input: p.send(bytearray(key)). The pane on the right is a gdb session whth the gef plugin enabled. You can see registers, stack and current instruction for a process called ./babyrev_level6.0. The program is about to run a call to glibc readline" /><br/>

  All the visualizations in this article emulate the way data is visualized in real-world
  scenarios, with tools like gdb or [PWNDBG](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/),
  popular in CTF competitions.
  My hope is that this will lower the steep learning curve of those tools.


### Moving data

The first instruction we are going to see is `mov`, which moves data around. It can move data from a register to another,
from a register to memory, or vice-versa from memory to a register

 These first examples are self-explanatory:

```nasm
mov rbx, 0x10  ;copies the integer 0x10 into rbx
mov rax, rbx   ;copies the content of rbx into rax
```

Moving data to memory requires some extra syntax:<br/>
The following snippet writes the byte `0xff` in the memory cell at address `0x10`.

```nasm
mov rax, 0x10
mov byte ptr [rax], 0xff
```

Let's break it down:
- First, we put in a register `0x10`, the address of the cell we want to write to.
- Then we perform a mov instruction with square brackets around the register name, to indicate that we want to move `0xff` in
the memory address pointed by the register, and not into the register itself.

Notice how in that example we moved a single byte, and we used the syntax `byte ptr`.
You can change that in `word`, `dword` or `qword` if you want to move a different amount of bytes.

The interactive example below allows you to experiment with all possible variations of the pointer syntax.
You can click "run" to see how the memory is affected

<PtrSyntaxEmbed client:load />


### A sidenote on endianness

We managed to reach this point by ignoring an important fact: x86-64 is a little endian architecture,
which means that numbers are not stored in the way you would expect.<br/>
In the previous example, you saw what the number `0x4242424242424242` looks like in memory,
but we choose that number carefully to hide the issue. In the next example, you can enter the number you want.<br/>
Can you spot what's happening?

<EndiannessEmbed client:load /><br/>

In case you missed it, numbers are being saved with their bytes in an inverted order:
For example, the number `0xcafe` is composed of the byte `ca` followed by `fe`,
but it will be saved as the byte `fe` followed by the byte `ca`.

What's going on here is that
both humans and computers use a positional number system to represent integers,
but with a different order.<br/>
When we (humans using Hindu-Arabic numerals) represent numbers,
we write the most significant value first, and continue in descending order.
This is the same as Big endian architectures.

```nasm
  human-readable decimal number
  1337 
  |  |
  |  Least significant digit 
  Most significant digit 

  human-readable hex number
  0xcafebabe  
    |     |
    |     Least significant byte
    Most significant byte
```
Little endian architectures write the least significant value first instead, and continue in ascending order.

This topic is explained in depth on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness), with some
useful diagrams that will solve any doubts you might have.<br/>
Endianness is only related to the way the processor handles integers. 
Other kinds of data, such as text, are usually encoded in the same order as you would expect.
Floating point numbers are stored in a completely different
format instead, you can read more about them 
[in this great article](https://fabiensanglard.net/floating_point_visually_explained/)
, or in 
[this visual guide by Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski/exposing-floating-point/)

### The stack

x64, like most architectures, has the concept of stack: an area in memory pointed
by the special register `rsp`.<br/>
You can add or remove elements from the top of the stack by using the
`push` and `pop` instructions. This is the most common interaction, but it's also valid to directly adjust the value of `rsp`.
In this interactive example
the stack area is highlighted in blue, together with the value of the `rsp` and `rax` registers.

<StackEmbed client:load /><br/>

There are two key elements you should notice by plaing with the example above:
- `rsp` points to the top of the stack. It is decreased by 8 when we push a value, and increased by 8 when we pop a value.
- Every time we pop a value from the stack that value is not deleted, the area of memory that contains it
simply stops being part of the stack. The only thing that changes is the memory address pointed by `rsp`.

Basically, `push rax` does the same as the following code:
```nasm
sub rsp, 8
mov qword ptr [rsp], rax
```

And `pop rax` does the same as the following code
```nasm
mov rax, qword ptr [rsp]
add rsp, 8
```

There is a confusing element here: when we put something onto the stack we are
growing the stack, and yet we are moving towards lower addresses of memory.

With the way we visualize memory this actually looks correct, the stack is growing 
towards the top.<br/>
But if we only look at the numeric adresses of elements on the stack, newer elements have smaller addresses,
which looks backwards.<br/>
Even when you are aware of this, it's common to get confused
and end up thinking:
"i put a new value on the stack, but it has a smaller address than the previous value, what is going on?"

### Memory alignment

I don't think memory alignment can be explained in a better way than 
what [this article does](https://web.archive.org/web/20080607055623/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/pa-dalign/), so check it out. Here we'll only focus on how memory alignment impacts
the way we visualize the stack:<br/>
Every time you push or pop something from the stack, you move the stack pointer
8 bytes up or down. If you observe carefully the 
previous example, you'll also notice that the addresses in the stack pointer are 
always multiples of 8: they always end with either `0` or `8`.

This kind of alignment is done on purpose for performance reasons, and you will encounter it everywhere.
As a consequence, when we visualize memory in a hexdump it's common to start from addresses multiples
of 8 or 16, so that data will fit properly in a row.

This is a hexdump taken from the stack memory of a function. Two different variables are highlighted:
one is the 32-bit integer `0xcafebabe`, the other is a stack canary, which we'll see in another article.
You can adjust the slider to change the start address in the hexdump.

<SliderAlign
  client:load 
  showAscii={true}
  /><br/>

What I'm trying to show here is that everything is relative.
What you see is always an abstract representation of the actual data,
and it's up to you to visualize it in a way that matches
your mental model.
