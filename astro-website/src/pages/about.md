I'm a computer science student at UniMib, living in Milan, Italy.<br/>
I like to work on <a href="/projects/" >projects</a> that span
the topics of cyber security, web development,
and distributed systems.

This website is my personal blog,
where I write about any topic that I find interesting and where I host my web-based projects.
