Hi, I'm Alberto Ventafridda.<br/>
I'm a software developer based in Milan, Italy.
I aspire to be a "jack of all trades, master of at least one",
however impossible this may sound.<br/>
 So far, my journey has covered web development,
cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and cybersecurity.

On this website I write about the challenges I encounter along the road,
and whatever I feel interesting to share.
I like the idea that the content I publish will help someone in the future,
however, right now it’s mostly written for myself.

## About this blog

The design of this website is a fork of
<a href="https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com">Tania Rascia</a>'s
blog and uses her Newmoon dark theme for
 the code snippets. 
 The pages are plain HTML files generated using custom Astro.js code.
 I host them on an equally over-engineered infrastructure.

 If you are interested about these details, check out the <a href="/posts/my-website/">blog post</a>
 I've written about it, or my [/uses](/uses/) page 
 which describes the software and tools i use everyday
