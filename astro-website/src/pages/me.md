Hello, i'm Alberto

I'm a developer fascinated by anything related to the digital world, currently
graviting around the domains of cyber security, web development, ops, and distributed systems.

I'm currently studying cs at uniMib, in Milan. In my free time i play ctfs
 and work on web projects i consider interesting.

I like to experiment with all kind of technologies, and although i'm most confident around javascript and React, i have 
experience working in a wide range of technologies and tech stacks, including kubernetes, docker, postgreSQL,
Flask, FastAPI, Devops and CI/CD pipelines and much more

You can check out all the tools and technlogies i use in my /use page

## introduction

This is a list of software and tools I use day-to-day for my work.
You can find a lot of pages like this one at https://uses.tech/
In fact, that is what inspired me to write this list


## my tools

- *vim* - My go to editor

- *tmux* - A terminal multiplexer. Combined with vim, it's how i navigate and organize
  multiple terminals and projects.

- *webstorm* - A powerful ide for the web. Sometimes vim is just not the right tool

- *docker* - Together with Docker-compose, it's how i manage most of my local development and testing environments.
  As i'm slowly graviting towards *NIX*, docker's role in my dependencies management may change

- *git* - It's how i manage all my projects but also, as a fan of the gitops approach, it's
 how i manage most of my server infrastructure and desktop environment.

- *ngrok* - A quick way to setup reverse shells (for ctf games, i should punctualize), and test complex environments

- *insomnia* - A good loking tool to test and call apis

- *burp suite* - An efficient tool to test and _break_ apis.

- *keepass* - An ancient password manager

## Languages

- My main language for frontend development is unsurprisingly Javascript/ES6, and if i'm working on a single-page-app
  my setup of choice is React, with Redux-toolkit.
  I've worked with several bundlers in the past, but now i mostly use vite.

- In the past i've written backends in Node, Php, and several framework but my favourite language choice remains Python, with
either FastAPI or Flask

Python is also my main scripting language, that i use for task automations and ctf exploits

## Devops and infrastructure

- I mostly use github workflows, with ghcr as container registry for my CI/CD pipelines
- I'm not a kubernetes expert, but i decided to host all my projects on a self-managed kubernetes cluster, running on OVH
  cheap VPSs
- On kubernetes, i like to use ArgoCD with a gitops approach
- I use Grafana and Prometheus to analyze and monitor my services and projects,
  and Grafana-Loki for log aggregation and management
