Hi, I'm Alberto. I'm a computer science student at uniMib, living in the suburbs of Milan.
In my free time i work on web <a href="/projects">projects</a> i consider interesting and
play <a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/">ctfs</a>, sometimes writing
<a href="/articles">articles</a> about the challenges i meet.

I like to learn and experiment with all kind of technologies, 
and although i'm most confident around javascript and React, i have 
experience working in a wide range of tech stacks including kubernetes, docker, postgreSQL,
Flask, FastAPI, Devops pipelines

You can check out all the tools and technlogies i use in my <a href="/uses">/uses</a> page

## About this blog

There is a reason this website has a great design: I'ts a fork of
<a href="https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com">tania rascia</a>'s blog,
leveraging her newmoon dark theme.
I've written a <a href="asdasd">blog post</a> dedicated to the making of this blog. Go check it out!

# uses

## introduction

This is a list of software and tools I use day-to-day for my work.
You can find a lot of pages like this one at https://uses.tech/
In fact, that is what inspired me to write this list


## my tools

- <a href="asd">vim</a> - My go to editor

- <a href="asd">tmux</a> - A terminal multiplexer. Combined with vim, it's how i navigate and organize
  multiple terminals and projects.

- <a href="asd">docker</a> - Together with Docker-compose, it's how i manage most of my local development and testing environments.

- <a href="asd">git</a> - It's how i manage all my projects but also, as a fan of the <a href="asd">gitops</a> approach, it's
 how i manage most of my server infrastructure and desktop environment.

- <a href="asd">webstorm</a> - A powerful ide for the web. Sometimes vim is just not the right tool

- <a href="asd">ngrok</a> - A quick way to setup reverse shells (for ctf games, i should point out), and test complex environments

- <a href="asd">insomnia</a> - A good loking tool to test and call apis

- <a href="asd">burp suite</a> - An efficient tool to test and _break_ apis.

- <a href="asd">keepass</a> - An ancient password manager

## Languages

- Frontend development is a world where technologies evolve quickly, and frameworks come and go.
  Javascript/ES6 and vanilla css however are here to stay, and it's what i have most experience with.
  I've worked with several js libraries and bundlers in the past, 
  however the ones i choose to use these days are
  React with Redux-Toolkit, Vite and astro.build

- I've written backends in Node, Php, and several framework but my favourite language choice remains
  <a href="asd">Python</a>, with either FastAPI or Flask

Python is also my main scripting language, that i use for task automations and ctf exploits

maybe i should change this whole section
something like

technical skills

### frontend

- js 
- react
- redux etch

### backend

- flask
- fastapi
- node
- php

### database

- postgres
- mysql
- redis

### devops and infrastructure

- stuff

### languages

- js
- c
- python
- java


## Devops and infrastructure

- I mostly use github workflows, with ghcr as container registry for my CI/CD pipelines
- I'm not a kubernetes expert, but i decided to host all my projects on a self-managed kubernetes cluster, running on OVH
  cheap VPSs
- On kubernetes, i like to use ArgoCD with a gitops approach
- I use Grafana and Prometheus to analyze and monitor my services and projects,
  and Grafana-Loki for log aggregation and management
