# uses

## introduction

This is a list of software and tools I use day-to-day for my work.
You can find a lot of pages like this one at https://uses.tech/
In fact, that is what inspired me to write this list


## my tools

- *vim* - My go to editor

- *tmux* - A terminal multiplexer. Combined with vim, it's how i navigate and organize
  multiple terminals and projects.

- *webstorm* - A powerful ide for the web. Sometimes vim is just not the right tool

- *docker* - Together with Docker-compose, it's how i manage most of my local development and testing environments.
  As i'm slowly graviting towards *NIX*, docker's role in my dependencies management may change

- *git* - It's how i manage all my projects but also, as a fan of the gitops approach, it's
 how i manage most of my server infrastructure and desktop environment.

- *ngrok* - A quick way to setup reverse shells (for ctf games, i should punctualize), and test complex environments

- *insomnia* - I use this tool whenever i'm dealing with documented apis

- *burp suite* - When i use this tool the apis are rarely documented - tip: check out the foxyProxy browser extension
  to manage the burp proxy painlessly

## Languages

- My main language for frontend development is unsurprisingly Javascript/ES6, and if i'm working on a single-page-app
  my setup of choice is React, with Redux-toolkit.
  I've worked with several bundlers in the past, but now i mostly use vite.

- In the past i've written backends in Node, Php, and several framework but my favourite language choice remains Python, with
either FastAPI or Flask

Python is also my main scripting language, that i use for task automations and ctf exploits

## Devops and infrastructure

- I mostly use github workflows, with ghcr as container registry for my CI/CD pipelines
- I'm not a kubernetes expert, but i decided to host all my projects on a self-managed kubernetes cluster, running on OVH
  cheap VPSs
- On kubernetes, i like to use ArgoCD with a gitops approach
- I use Grafana and Prometheus to analyze and monitor my services and projects,
  and Grafana-Loki for log aggregation and management 

## Utilities

- *keepass* - An ancient password manager

- *obsidian* - A note taking app

## Design

- *photoshop* - I've used this software a lot, but i don't have a license anymore so this is
  not really in my toolbox anymore.

- *gimp* - An open source image editor. I've grown to like it,
  but i still think about photoshop every time i want to deselect something and instead i duplicate the image.
